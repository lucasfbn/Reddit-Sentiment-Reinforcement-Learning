partierock;1612134919;l9orij;59;MEDV COPRF Additional DD;"Here is another DD on MEDV. This was not written by me.  They are a new user here but asked me to share this on their behalf. I don't know their Reddit username as they wrote this on another forum. If they share their user info I will post their user name here. I take zero credit for this write up. 


EDIT: This was written by u/Investor4_red_Ver 


There are numerous good posts that are talking about MEDV. They include numerous links to the various webinars, press releases, and interviews relating to the company. In all they present a compelling story and reason to invest in this company. Today, I wanted to talk about the numbers and will discuss the information found in those links. The following are my thoughts and opinions on what was found in those links and why I feel that this stock is a good investment. You may not agree or place more emphasis on other aspects of a business but the following is just another opinion to consider. I hope you find this helpful, and see that just based on ONE revenue stream this stock is very undervalued with a projected PE ratio less than 1. Consider that it’s common for other companies in this market segment to have PE ratios in the 20s!! 

Now, the latest financials released in late fall 2020, tell the story of a company in transition. Medivolve at the time was QuestCap Inc. QuestCap Inc. was started in early 2020. Doug Sommerville, CEO of Medivolve (formally QuestCap Inc.), discusses this evolution from the QuestCap to Medivolve in the various interviews and webinars. Suffice to say that Doug and his team had the vision to see what others had not, the need for mobile testing at scale and they knew just how to do it. After multiple agreements and a proven test-run in California, Medivolve now has 64 mobile sites taking online bookings through their testbeforeyougo website. An additional 24 sites are coming soon and more beyond that. What does soon mean, well I wouldn’t be surprised to see those additional 24 within the next couple of weeks, bringing the total to 88 sites across the US. As of the latest press releases, Medivolve has supply agreements totalling over 740 mobile testing locations around the US. Medivolve is moving towards filling all those locations as soon as possible and possibly by early April. 

Just think of that………roughly 740 locations around the US. That’s impressive and the agreements are in place. 

Now on to the Financials for the last quarter. These have not come out yet but I expect them to include the revenue from their test-run in California and beyond to the end of the quarter. Its important to note that Medivolve has a number of other revenue streams other than just the mobile testing sites. I expect to get more information on those streams in the next round of financials. For now I’m ONLY considering the revenue generated through the mobile testing sites. Once we have a better idea what the other revenue streams are generating the overall picture of the company will be clearer. For now, just considering the revenue from the mobile sites is compelling enough in my opinion. 
Based on the January 14th 2021 press release, Medivolve stated that the 7-day rolling average for the mobile sites was 75 tests/day at an average of $95/test. In past releases, Medivolve has stated that at times some sites process over 200 tests/day. Its understandable that new sites will not process as many tests as those sites that have been up and running for longer. Now, let’s dig into the numbers: 

At each mobile testing locations:
75 tests/day x $95US/test = $7,125US/day
$7,125US/day x 30/days = $213,750US/month

Medivolve has stated their EBITDA margin is 55%. For more on EBITDA see the following: 
https://www.google.com/search?q=ebitda&amp;rlz=1C1SQJL_enCA795CA795&amp;oq=ebidta&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i10i433l3j0i10i395l6.2862j1j15&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8

$213,750US/month x 0.55 EBITDA Margin = $117,562.50US EBITDA/month
$117,562.50US EBITDA/month x 1.28 CA/US = $150,480CA EBITDA/month

For 64 mobile testing sites: 
$150,480CA EBITDA/month x 64 Sites = $9,630,720 CA EBITDA/month
$9,630,720 CA EBITDA/month x 12 months/year = $115,568,640 CA EBITDA/year

Currently there are 170,000,000 shares for Medivolve 
$115,568,640 CA EBITDA/year / 170,000,000 shares = $0.68 CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis

For 88 sites that is $0.93CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis. 

Now assume they expand up to the 740 sites: 
100 sites  $1.06CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis($150,480,000/year)
200 sites  $2.12CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis($300,960,000/year)
300 sites  $3.19CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis($541,728,000/year)
400 sites  $4.25CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis($722,304,000/year)
500 sites  $5.31CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis($902,880,000/year)
600 sites  $6.37CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis($1,083,456,000/year)
700 sites  $7.44CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis($1,264,032,000/year)
740 sites  $7.86CA EBITDA/Share on a yearly basis($1,336,262,400/year)

Current stock price for Medivolve is $0.56CA/share

So you can see that at present and in the near future Medivolve is currently making more per share than what it is currently trading at. Thus the projected PE ratios look as follows:

For 64 Sites
$0.56CA/share / $0.68 CA EBITDA/Share = 0.82

For 88 Sites
$0.56CA/share / $0.93 CA EBITDA/Share = 0.60

Its important to note that this company is generating millions per month. Do your own DD but other companies in their market segment have PE ratios in the 20’s. That means those companies are trading roughly 20x the value they make per share. In the case of Medivolve, if the PE ratio was 20, then: 

For 64 Sites
$0.68 CA EBITDA/Share x 20 = $13.60/share

For 88 Sites
$0.93 CA EBITDA/Share x 20 = $18.60/share

Now its up to you as the investor to determine what you think that value (PE ratio) should be based on whatever you deem important when investing in a company. I’ve looked at other companies and seen their PE ratios as high as 60 and they aren’t making any money but the promise of revenue is there. For me, this is why I really like where Medivolve is at. They have proven revenue generation and a model that is easily scalable. Their upfront costs are low and their EBITDA margin is near 55%. 

Say you don’t think a PE ratio of 20 is realistic for a company that makes millions a month and has exposure to all of the US. Say you think a PE ratio of 4 is more realistic. At a PE ratio of 4 you have the following stock price projections: 

64 sites  $0.68CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $2.72CA/share
88 sites  $0.93CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $3.72CA/share
100 sites  $1.06CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $4.24CA/share
200 sites  $2.12CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $8.48CA/share
300 sites  $3.19CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $12.76CA/share
400 sites  $4.25CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $17.00CA/share
500 sites  $5.31CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $21.24CA/share
600 sites  $6.37CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $25.48CA/share
700 sites  $7.44CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $29.76CA/share
740 sites  $7.86CA EBITDA/Share x 4 = $31.44CA/share

So I hope you’ve found this information useful and informative. Just by looking at ONE revenue stream, I believe that Medivolve is a compelling investment. I personally believe that the way we do business has forever changed and Medivolve is in a prime position to grow with that change. 

I’d rather put my money in a company that is generating millions a month, has a proven business model, room to scale up, and is not on the verge of bankruptcy. For me, these are just a few of the reasons by I’m invested in this company. Please do your own DD and figure out what you value in a company. For me, the above reasons are important to me. 

Note Medivolve just announced an agreement to purchase up to 40% of a Marvel Diagnostics Inc. The funding will help complete their testing of their innovative BlowFISH devise to help with testing. The possibilities for this technology are endless and would work extremely well with the mobile testing facilities Medivolve is establishing. Imagine hundreds of testing facilities across the US where you can get tested for a variety of illnesses by simply breathing into a device. The potential revenue would be huge, and that isn’t even accounted for in my previous calculations. 

For me, based on all the press releases, webinars, and interviews, I believe this company is a solid investment now, in the short-term, and well……for the long-term I can’t even imagine.

JohnSmathers21;1612135795;l9p22p;33;AAU is A mining company that could benefit from a surge in the price of Silver;"Canadian Mining company with a massive silver/ gold operation they are in the process of building this could catch the ride of the silver squeeze. as of 6pm Silver futures are at 28.50 , up 3.50... at .70 a share, and with a recent high of 1.26 I think we could see those levels this week even. the average daily volume is around 2.5 million but on friday 30 million shares were traded. The float is 115m and there's no short interest so dont go thinking im pumping ""THE NEXT BIG SHORT SQWZE"" like every new youtube video is now claiming. (shoot me) ...

think of this is really as a correlation play off of silver with a potential 50-70% gain (if the rush on silver is sustained)

alexsmith2332;1612141425;l9qwut;31;For everyone who has created new brokerage accounts please dont transfer straight away;"I noticed a post which said the pennystocks forum is now one of the trending ones and there are a lot of people looking to move on from Robinhood to something else and have already started the process.

While I strongly recommend you start the process to create the account, **i would hold off on transferring immediately.** To understand the reasoning behind this, please understand what happens behind the scenes in a transfer between two brokerages

# [TLDR] 

Dont start the transfer until you have disposed of the stocks or made the trades you wanted to do this week since transfers can take from 1-2 weeks and you will be locked out of your account at that time. Also strongly recommend funding your new account with a few hundred dollars to tide you over the time when you cant trade (if you need to day trade)  


# Long form version

1. When you initiate a transfer from robinhood to say TD Ameritrade or webull, the receiving firm will send the data you specified in your transfer to ACATS which which will send a notification to robinhood
2. When robinhood gets a notification that the transfer request is was requested, they first need to validate the request before they start the process. To quote the [finra site](https://www.finra.org/investors/learn-to-invest/brokerage-accounts/understanding-brokerage-account-transfer-process)*To best prevent the unauthorized transfer of an account, delivering firms will reject any transfer request where certain data (for example the customer’s name and/or Social Security number) provided by the receiving firm does not match the information on the delivering firm’s records.*
3. Once your transfer request is approved by Robinhood, the ACATS will send a list of assets (stocks, cash, crypto, etc) to the new receiving site. Now Robinhood and other brokers will immediately lock down your account for the duration of the transfer which basically means the following--- **You cant close any of your trades** (for example, one of your stocks does really well and you now cant sell since you are locked out of your account. You cant also exercise any options (actually if you have active options, your transfer might even get denied. depending on the broker)
4. The duration of the lock can range from **3-15 days** depending on the time it takes for robinhood to deal with the rush of outgoing accounts and the receiving firm to validate all the assets and complete the transfer .Now as you are aware, some sites dont accept specific stocks such as OTC stocks, non nasdaq stocks, crypto, Fractional shares and so on. Different brokerages deal with them differently like TD Ameritrade will sell off your fractional shares and liquidate it as cash while webull will reject the non supported stocks and the whole transfer completely.
5. An important thing to note about the t**ransfer being rejected** is that now you are truly stuck in limbo land. You no longer have access to your stocks and you cant do anything on robinhood as well as the account will remain locked until robinhood gets a notification from the ACATS about the rejection. So your 5 day transfer suddenly turns into a 2 week of no access since now you need to wait to let robinhood enable access to your account before you do this again.

# So are you saying we should not transfer ???

No, my point was very simple.

1. This week is going to be super volatile and if there any stocks you are worried about which you might think can crash or really explode in the coming days, ensure you sell them and take profits before you initiate the transfer. **Do note, when a transfer is initiated,** all sell or stop orders are cancelled so you could really lose out on the huge spike or take a huge loss with a price dump.
2. Also **close off any options** so that suddenly dont find that your option lost or gained a ton of money during the transfer and you cant do anything about this.
3. Since you opened the new account, **I would fund it with something like $100 or more** so that if required you can trade with the new account while settling things in the robinhood account. This gives you practice in the new account and gets your muscle memory built of where to do what (and how to do it). Also **if you already initiated the transfer,** you no longer have access to the robinhood stocks and cash for now and hence putting in a couple hundred dollars might ensure you dont miss out on potential plays.
4. Once you settled the volatile stocks, start the transfer process and meanwhile continue trading on your new platform since you already have some cash there.

For those looking to figure out which platform to move to, this [**post comparing different trading platforms might be of interest to you.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/l8e01q/for_those_looking_to_move_from_robinhood_here_is/)

I just wanted to post this out before people wake up on Monday morning and are ranting that they cant get to their accounts or cant close out trades. I have been in this situation before I transferred to TD Ameritrade before ( I use TD Ameritrade for my day trades and webull for longer swings) and hence I just wanted to give some warning on some things to be mindful of.";pennystocks

clubpenguin7;1612135838;l9p2l5;22;[Commons vs Warrants] A Quick Look at SHLL/HYLN and KCAC/QS;"Disclaimer: I am not a financial advisor

I was interested in whether buying commons or warrants would give better returns for CCIV/LUCID and decided to look at SHLL/HYLN and KCAC/QS since they are both in the EV space.

# SHLL/HYLN

On Jun 19, 2020, SHLL had a definitive agreement with Hyliion (HYLN) so a few days after on Jun 21 the common closed at $18.31 and the warrant at $5.75 or a $12.56 difference with the common being above the warrant's intrinsic value of $5.75 + $11.50 = $17.25.

On Sep 28, 2020, the merger completed with the commons closing at $53.23 and the warrants at $27.64 or a $25.59 difference with the common being above the warrant's intrinsic value of $27.64 + $11.50 = $39.14. This means assuming you bought shares at the definitive agreement, you would have a net return of investment of 190% \[($53.23 - $18.31) / $18.31\] and for warrants, you would be at 380% \[($27.64 - $5.75) / $5.75\]. It would seem that warrants would be the better choice as the net ROI is twice that of the commons.

Following the merge on Sep 28, 2020, the commons and warrants dropped in price drastically until Nov 30, 2020, when both the warrants became exercisable and they were called upon for redemption. From then, the difference between the common and warrants was around $11.50 but prior to becoming exercisable, warrants has always lagged behind the commons price meaning the warrant price + $11.50 would be below the commons price.

Upon becoming exerciseable, the commons closed at $19.18 and the warrants at $7.60 or a $11.58 difference. This means assuming you bought shares at the definitive agreement, you would have a net return of investment of 4.75% \[($19.18 - $18.31) / $18.31\] and for warrants, you would be at 32% \[($7.60 - $5.75) / $5.75\]. Again similar to the net ROI at the merger date, the warrants would be the better choice as the net ROI is \~7x that of the commons.

|Time|Commons Price|Warrants Price|Commons ROI|Warrants ROI|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Merge|$53.23|$27.64|190%|380%|
|Exerciseable|$19.18|$7.60|4.75%|32%|

By looking at the steady decline after merging, the optimal strategy would seem to be get warrants and sell them after merge is announced. The lagging aspect of the warrants here benefits the warrant holder here as it indicates the commons are overvalued and/or the warrants are undervalued so that eventually once exerciseable, the warrants will close the gap and be profitable.

[SHLL\/HYLN](https://preview.redd.it/qkam7acd5re61.png?width=773&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7c2203095866ab035aabc55ee7a02491925e53f1)

# KCAC/QS

Another SPAC that I wanted to compare would be KCAC/QS.

On Sep 3, 2020, KCAC had a definitive agreement with QuantumScape (QS) with the common closed at $22.50 and the warrant at $6.46 or a $16.03 difference with the common being above the warrant's intrinsic value of $6.46 + $11.50 = $17.96.

On Nov 25, 2020, the merger completed with a few days on Nov 29, the commons closing at $47.00 and the warrants at $12.80 or a $34.20 difference with the common being above the warrant's intrinsic value of $12.80 + $11.50 = $24.30. This means assuming you bought shares at the definitive agreement, you would have a net return of investment of 109% \[($47.00 - $22.50) / $22.50\] and for warrants, you would be at 98% \[($12.80 - $6.46) / $6.46\]. It would seem unlike SHLL/HYLN that commons would be the better choice but the ROI are of similar magnitude.

While the warrants are still not exerciseable and hence not called for redemption, it is interesting to note that the price of commons and warrants drastically went up after merging as a direct contrast to SHLL/HYLN which tanked. The commons and warrants peaked on the same day on Dec 21 with the commons closing at $131.67 and the warrants at $42.99 or a $88.68 difference with the common being above the warrant's intrinsic value of $42.99 + $11.50 = $54.49. This means assuming you bought shares at the definitive agreement, you would have a net return of investment of 485% \[($131.67 - $22.50) / $22.50\] and for warrants, you would be at 565% \[($42.99 - $6.46) / $6.46\]. The warrants at that time would be better choice.

Now looking at the price today Jan 27, 2021, the price of commons and warrants started to go down from its peak and the commons closed at $45.56 and the warrants at $28.58 or a $16.98 difference with the common being above the warrant's intrinsic value of $28.58 + $11.50 = $40.08. This means assuming you bought shares at the definitive agreement, you would have a net return of investment of 102% \[($45.56 - $22.50) / $22.50\] and for warrants, you would be at 342% \[($28.58 - $6.46) / $6.46\]. The warrants would be the better choice as the net ROI is \~3x the commons.

|Time|Commons Price|Warrants Price|Commons ROI|Warrants ROI|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Merge|$47.00|$12.80|109%|98%|
|Peak|$131.67|$42.99|485%|565%|
|Today|$45.56|$28.58|102%|342%|

# Summary

It seems in warrants would be the better choice in more scenarios (note: this does not consider taxes). Also, it was interesting to see different behaviours upon merging. Thoughts?";SPACs

[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-roman-health-m-a-idUSKBN29W30R](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-roman-health-m-a-idUSKBN29W30R)

The SPAC is unnamed, but ""Ro"" always looked like a good target for HAAC. There are other SPACs in health and tech-enabled health, but  HAAC's mission statement aligns uniquely well with Ro.

This article was recently published, arguing instead for Color as HAAC's target: [https://exitsandoutcomes.com/why-the-livongo-founders-spac-will-acquire-color/](https://exitsandoutcomes.com/why-the-livongo-founders-spac-will-acquire-color/)

Newcmt12345;1612145082;l9s2sa;193;Ark Big Ideas 2021: Read Through to SPACs;"Ark has been a big name in SPACs, investing in general in 2020/2021, and followed closely on this subreddit. They have invested in SPACs including HIMS, OPEN, LGVW, and EXPC, which often saw an increase in trading price after Ark's involvement. Names such as SRAC and NPA also received a boost with the announcement of the Ark Space ETF. So it is helpful to understand what Ark is looking at when investing in SPACs.

Ark released their ""[Big Ideas 2021](https://ark-invest.com/big-ideas-2021/)"" presentation last week. The below goes through the high level industries and ideas Ark is looking at, as well as relevant SPACs to those industries/ideas. While these SPACs are not listed by Ark in the presentation, they are my summary of those that fit, and poised to benefit from, the themes Ark lays out.

1. **Deep Learning:** AI/Computer written software code
   1. **Key SPAC Names:**  SAII, ACEV, THBR
      1. Ark mention autonomous vehicles (among many other end markets). While this is focused more on software, [SAII recently rumored to be in talks with Otonomo](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-29/israeli-startup-otonomo-said-nearing-merger-with-software-spac?sref=vdKurlBI), an Israeli startup that operates a data platform linked to millions of connected cars.
      2. Ark also mention a jump in specialized chips in this section (don’t specifically say FPGAs \[ACEV\] or SOCs \[THBR\], but could be applicable).
   2. **SPAC names I wouldn't include, but related:** GRAF/VLDR, GMHI/LAZR, IPV, CLA, CGRO, CFAC (rumored)
      1. While autonomous is mentioned, the focus is more on deep learning software and chips enabling it than the LiDAR players, so don’t include them here.
2. **The Re-invention of the Data Center:** Data centers shifting to new hardware, such as ARM, RISC-V, GPUs, TPUs, and FPGAs
   1. **Key SPAC Names:** ACEV
      1. A lot of this section is about ARM processors. But, they specifically mention accelerators, including FPGAs, replacing CPUs. ACEV target Achronix is one of the few independent FPGA producers.
   2. **SPAC names I wouldn’t Include, but related:** THBR
      1. FPGAs specifically mentioned, but no mention of SOCs or autonomous, so don’t think THBR as applicable here.
3. **Virtual Worlds:** Virtual reality, augmented reality, metaverse, and other futuristic steps in the design and monetization of video games
   1. **Key SPAC Names:** FEAC/SKLZ
      1. **Virtual Gaming:** Around virtual worlds, Roblox IPO is a prime target, although this section talks about areas outside of just VR/metaverse. They talk about different methods of monetizing video games, which SKLZ (former FEAC SPAC) fits well with.
   2. **SPAC names I wouldn't include, but related:** LCA/GNOG, DMYD, DMYT/RSI, DEAC/DKNG
      1. **Online Gambling:** While the online gambling players are technically “gaming”, this section seems more focused on video game monetization than gambling, so I don’t include them.
4. **Digital Wallets:** Online first financial accounts, banking, and lending platforms
   1. **Key SPAC Names:** VIH, IPOE, FUSE (rumored), FTOC (rumored), NEBU/LPRO, FSRV, BFT
      1. VIH immediately comes to mind as the SPAC whose presentation talks specifically about digital wallets. But it appears that they are also talking about online-based banking services here, which can broaden potential targets to include IPOE/SoFi (only SPAC explicitly mentioned by Ark), the rumored FUSE/MoneyLion deal, the rumored Payoneer/ FTOC merger
      2. They also mention digital lenders, which could include NEBU/LPRO or FSRV (don’t mention either, but mention FSRV partner AFFM)
   2. **SPAC names I wouldn't include, but related:** FTAC/PAYA &amp; SPRQ
      1. Fintech payment enabling fintech SPACs, but they aren’t really digital wallets/consumer focused.
5. **Bitcoin:** No explanation needed on this, they dedicated a section to the world's largest cryptocurrency
   1. **Key SPAC Names:** VIH
      1. **Digital Wallet:** While crypto exchanges and other bitcoin-related names have been rumored to potentially be evaluating SPACs, VIH is the only crypto-related name currently in the SPAC universe
6. **Electric Vehicles:** An area well covered on this subreddit, EVs are another key sector pointed out by Ark.
   1. **Key SPAC Names:** SHLL/HYLN, DPHC/RIDE, SPAQ/FSR, HCAC/GOEV, VTIQ/NKLA, ACTC, CIIC, NGA, FIII, GIK, PSAC, CCIV (rumor), KCAC/QS, PIC/XL, RMG/RMO, ALUS, CLII, TPGY, SBE, FVAC/MP, AMCI, THBR, ACEV
      1. **EV OEMs:** The major EV OEM SPACs are obvious candidates here, being SHLL/HYLN, DPHC/RIDE, SPAQ/FSR, HCAC/GOEV, VTIQ/NKLA, ACTC, CIIC, NGA, FIII, GIK, PSAC, CCIV (rumor)
      2. **EV Parts:** Parts suppliers, such as KCAC/QS, PIC/XL, RMG/RMO, and ALUS are also all poised to benefit from electrification
      3. **EV Charging Stations:** The EV Charging stations, such as CLII, TPGY, SBE, are all going to see great benefit from further EV adoption
      4. **Raw Materials:** FVAC/MP is also exposed to broader EV trends via NdPr output at the mine, which is currently used in 90% of EVs
      5. **FCEV Parts:** AMCI is acquiring a fuel cell provider, which are used for FCEVs and mentioned throughout their presentation
      6. **Semiconductors:** THBR’s semiconductors are being used for electrification, among other auto-based end markets. ACEV is similar, with their FPGAs being used for the future of the auto-market.
   2. **SPAC names I wouldn't include, but related:** TRNE/DM
   3. TRNE talks about how additive manufacturing enables EVs, among many other industries, although it’s not a key focus/driver.
7. **Automation:** Robotics factories, production, and manufacturing. Do not know of any SPACs in this area currently.
8. **Autonomous Ride Hailing:** Specifically looking at robo-taxis
   1. **Key SPAC Names:**  GRAF/VLDR, GMHI/LAZR, IPV, CLA, CGRO, CFAC (rumored), THBR, ACEV
      1. **LiDAR:** While Ark’s thesis is looking more at the platform providers, any autonomous driving will be enabled by the LiDAR providers GRAF/VLDR, GMHI/LAZR, IPV, CLA, CGRO, CFAC (rumored)
      2. **Semiconductors:** THBR is looking to produce semi’s for “safety systems” for future vehicles (autonomous). ACEV is similarly looking to use their FPGAs for the future of cars.
   2. **SPAC names I wouldn't include, but related:** SHLL/HYLN, DPHC/RIDE, SPAQ/FSR, HCAC/GOEV, VTIQ/NKLA, ACTC, CIIC, NGA, FIII, GIK, PSAC, CCIV (rumor)
   3. **EV OEMs:** While it’s possible the major EV OEMs could have autonomous vehicles, and some even mention this, it is not as key to their investment thesis as the electrification side
9. **Drone Delivery:** Autonomous air travel, mostly for ecommerce delivery and passengers
   1. **Key SPAC Names:** Haven’t seen any SPACS that really relate to this theme
   2. **SPAC names I wouldn't include, but related:** EXPC, ASPL (rumor), ZNTE (rumor)
      1. The Ark presentation seems to mostly be mentioning eCommerce-type fulfilment, although there is some discussion of autonomous passenger deliver
10. **Orbital Aerospace:** Space-related names including connectivity and hypersonic point-to-point travel
11. **Key SPAC Names:** SRAC, IPOA/SPCE, NPA
   1. **Satellite Launch/Positioning:** SRAC is likely the most relevant, as it specializes in putting satellites into their proper orbit.
   2. **Space-based Connetivity:** NPA also helps enable space-based communication, which Ark mentions.
   3. **Hypersonic Point-to-Point:** And finally, Ark mentions hypersonic point-to-point travel, which IPOA/SPCE is looking to get involved in
12. **3D Printing:** Another straight forward one, Ark thinks additive manufacturing will revolutionize manufacturing
13. **Key SPAC Names:** TRNE/DM
   1. **3D Printing:** DM is a 3D printer, this one is clearly the most applicable
14. **Long Read Sequencing:** DNA sequencing (think ILMN), the next step is those who can perform longer ""reads"" of DNA (PACB, Oxford Nanopore). I have not seen any SPACs targeting this area.
15. **Multi-Cancer Screening:** Looking at liquid biopsies/blood tests for early cancer detection.
16. **Key SPAC Names:** CNAC/DMTK
17. **SPAC names I wouldn't include, but related:** VGAC
   1. **Genetic Testing:** VGAC is rumored to be in discussions with 23andMe. Their current product is mostly around ancestry testing, but they also are looking to do health screening per the Bloomberg article. Still, Ark is focused mostly on cancer testing, and there is no evidence they are specializing in cancer screening.
18. **Cell &amp; Gene Therapy Generation 2:** Self-explanatory, cell and gene therapies, Ark looks at the next stage shifting from liquid to solid tumors, autologous (cells from yourself) to allogeneic (cells from anybody) cell therapy, and ex vivo to in vivo gene editing.
19. **Key SPAC Names:** GXGX
   1. **Allogenic Gene Therapy:** Ark specifically talks about allogenic therapies, of which GXGX is acquiring one.

None of the above is supposed to be investment advice, a recommendation to buy, or suggest Ark is or will be involved at all in any of the above names. Do your own due diligence.

I and others I advise own positions in some of the above securities

Now consider this, BRPA has a float of approximately in the 6 hundred thousands (forgot the exact number) and a market cap of **157.907M:** [**https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BRPA/**](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BRPA/)**. IQVIA,** pretty well known marketing company estimates that the gross sales will be **1.4billion** IN US ALONE, which is **700 million** for neurorx and **700 million** for rlftf. This is just considering the fact that there IS a vaccine that can prevent covid. If for some reasons there is a mutation that isnt covered by the vaccine, the gross sales would skyrocket. With 700million dollars of potential gross sales, we get a 450% potential increase in market cap. Also, note that in general companies are valued higher than their actual gross sales by a significant amount so **400%** is the **MINIMUM** if this data goes well.

Last weeks post on BFT's evaluation was written here :

[https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/l4ce0j/bft\_evaluation\_by\_a\_professional/](https://www.reddit.com/r/SPACs/comments/l4ce0j/bft_evaluation_by_a_professional/)

I have seen a lot of misunderstandings about the BFT Lock-Up period and asked Alex if he could do a write up for us. Big thanks to Alex for delivering this high quality content! 

Warning : This post is long. I have linked a few of his previous videos at the bottom explaining the lock up period. They are quite thorough and worth the watch. 

BFT Lock-up Explained : 

There are two key subjects of the lock-up - the existing shareholders in Paysafe currently, and the new investors into Paysafe, those in the PIPE and the SPAC sponsor. Each of these are subject to different terms under the lock-up and the focus of this article is on the existing shareholders in BFT and the lock-up terms they are subject to.

For the avoidance of doubt, as retail investors into the SPAC, we are not subject to any lock-up, and we can buy/sell at any stage.

Lock-up periods:

The existing shareholders in Paysafe are two private equity firms, CVC and Blackstone. They made their investment into Paysafe in 2017.

Private equity is a model whereby a closed-end fund is raised (once capital is raised, the fund is closed to new investors and the amount of capital fixed) and this is invested into a number of companies. The fund makes its money, in two ways, charging a fee on the amount of money it manages, but the larger component is through taking a share of the profits generated from selling these companies it has invested in, typically 20%. Private equity funds have a set life of 10 years, from the point in time it is raised, to the point at which is should have sold all of its investments. In rare circumstances this can be extended with investor consent, but is typically only sought in situations where it cannot achieve liquidity on certain assets. Private equity funds target returns of 2-3x over a 3-5 year period; holding investments in companies for longer than this, is detrimental to other fund KPIs, specifically IRR, and so this isn’t common at all.

There are two important points to note in relation to Blackstone and CVC here. Firstly, we know the specific funds they invested into Paysafe from and how long they have until they either need to sell their investment, or seek an extension from investors. Given the liquidity of this once the lockup has expired, as a public company, it is highly unlikely such a request would be made, especially as at the current price level, the return is greater than the target returns for private equity funds. CVC need to sell their stake by 2023, Blackstone by 2025.

As private equity funds don’t speculate on public markets, holding such an investment for longer than required, or necessary to generate sufficient returns, is unlikely. As we can see from the table below, on the basis of the cash already returned to the funds from the initial merger and the pro forma ownership, we can see this hurdle has been hit and exceeded.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/bbahqs0kere61.png?width=1744&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1fca883af76fd8e6f2df04e9fa6dc971a4548b29

Not only have the funds held Paysafe for an optimum period, but they also have hit their return target. These signs do indicate that they are likely to sell upon expiration of the lockup.

Combined, CVC and Blackstone have a large shareholding in the pro-forma entity (c.46%) and are subject to a shorter lockup period than the PIPE investors (80 days if trading above $12 for 20 days within a 30 consecutive day period – 60 days thereafter this 20 day period, versus 170 days for the PIPE). This only becomes effective when the transaction has completed – i.e. the date the ticker changes.

The magnitude of the stakes they hold and will sell is important, but the dynamic against this is the institutional interest in the sector. Look at the investors in Affirm, Adyen, Paypal, Nuvei, a large number of big institutional investors in these stocks who hold meaningful stakes, can’t invest into BFT until the transaction is done and it is no longer a SPAC and is trading as PYSF.

The key here is how this offsets the dynamic from CVC and Blackstone selling their stakes (and the mechanism they chose to do this through). Expect to see a secondary offering to sell their stake – will mean it can be done off-market and potentially have minimal impact in the stock price. Selling it on open market will have a more meaningful impact.

TLDR:

At completion, 46% of Paysafe’s shares will be held by private equity funds - CVC and Blackstone. The soonest these guys will be able to sell their shares will be 80 days AFTER the merger is completed. This will likely cause the share price to dip. At the same time, the impact may be offset by other institutions looking to invest in PaySafe.

GameStop remains an unprofitable business- a quick Google search shows they lost $673 million in 2018. If GME holders keep their stock, but the business keeps losing money, what happens?

First question is when people here say a certain stock they're holding is a % of their portfolio, like 50%, does that mean the total average cost of that stock is 50%, or the total average cost + unrealized gains is 50%?

Second question is my current cash/investment ratio is 4/3 at around $40k/$30k with all my investments in individual stocks, and I may need to have $150k within 1-2 years. I have a job that has a decent TC where if I hold everything in cash, I should be able to reach that target easily.

abqguardian;1612145401;l9s6i6;209;Another thread about next week;"So I'm another noob who is lurking the stock subs because of the GME frenzy. It's been really interesting seeing the different takes on what's been going down and what's going to happen next week. r/wallstreetbets has some really great info but also lots of 12 year olds and bots, so it's hard to know what's real or have a real conversation. So I'm hoping yall can help me out and give me your opinions on the following:

1) r/wallstreetbets is convinced that next week GME will rise to at least $1000. I know enough to know thats pretty crazy, but with all the unnatural enthusiasm and attention, plus retail buying was throttled last week. Theres also the short stock percentage, which is being debated on. What are yalls opinions on the likelihood of it reaching $1000? What do you think will be the peak?

2) they're also heavily stoked about AMC. They aren't pretending it's the new GME, but they think it will rise to $50-$100 next week. They think there will be a squeeze plus massive retail buying. There definitely seems to be enthusiasm for it. What do yall think will happen with AMC? And what will it peak be?

3) S3 just came out saying the short stock percentage is a lot lower than last week. r/wallstreetbets doesn't believe the numbers, and honestly they seem to have a decent argument. S3s update contradicted their info from earlier and Friday. Also the amount of shorted stock cleared doesn't seem possible with the amount of volume traded Friday (30m short covered out of 50m). Do you think r/wallstreetbets are kidding themselves? Or do they have a point? Also, call me cynical but I have no problem believing the hedge funds would bribe S3 to give out false information on a Sunday night.

Full disclosure, I bought one GME share just to be part of the fun. I'm not expecting any kind of return and I'm cool with losing it. I'm just interested and would like some honest opinions.";stocks

Also I read somewhere that its gona take 1.5 days to cover those calls, so Monday-Tuesday before market opens on Tuesday those calls should all be fulfilled? 

2: if what S3 says is true, which is kinda fishy cos of the earlier tweet, but lets assume they are true and that short interest did decrease, does that mean the stock could drop quick like it did on Wednesday or would it be gradual and people would have time to exit and not be bag holders?

rising_mod;1612136704;l9pcut;8;What is the name of this type of futures contract? Could it replace short selling?;"**TL;DR**: The lending fees demanded by share owners is artificially small as a result of public policy failure. This creates the environment for hedge funds to run the market price into the ground. If we priced liquidity risk into the cost of borrowing shares, perhaps via a futures contract, hedge funds would not be able to manipulate the markets in the way they have as of late.

#Problem Statement

Short selling has been dominating the headlines, recently. In particular, it's noteworthy that there were/are more shares of GameStop in circulation than exist. Is that a sound market? Is the market coherent when buying a share may mean taking ownership of a share on loan? Is it logical to allow that same share to be loaned out again by the second person who simultaneously owns it? I'm not so sure it is.

In particular, I'm bothered by the logical extreme of this scenario. What if 100% of owners of GameStop shares decided to A) hold and B) not lend? Who is the rightful owner of those *extra* shares in circulation? All owners of shares went to the market, paid the market price, and became an investor in the company. The market said with 100% certainty, ""When you buy a share, you are the owner"". It also promised, ""When you lend a share, you are also the owner, you just can't trade it until the lessee covers.""

Owners of shares are willing to loan them out for tiny fees because they are being given an irrational guarantee by the market. I don't really blame the market participants, everyone is just doing the most profitable thing for all parties involved. We need guardrails to prevent bad outcomes. This is simply a public policy failure.

As a result of this guaranteed ownership, the owners of shares do not properly factor risk into their decision to loan out what they own. If there was a risk of the shares being lost, they would be much more skeptical of loaning them. **The fees demanded by investors to loan their shares out would be far higher if they priced in the risk that their position in the security would evaporate.**

It's fascinating how this problem leads to hedge funds manipulating the markets. You see, since investors are not properly factoring risk into their decision to lend, they are demanding exceptionally low fees. There is of course the risk they take on with not being able to trade, a price risk, but they completely ignore the liquidity risk because the market has told them there is no such risk, they're guaranteed to retain ownership. Since the fees they demand are so low, the capital required to borrow these shares is artificially low. Hedge funds can swoop in, pay obscenely low fees, and add significant sell pressure on an asset with relatively small amounts of cash.

Since the capital requirement for making such trades is artificially small, due to public policy which supposedly guarantees no liquidity risk, hedge funds are able to move the market price. They can exert outsized downward price pressure through short selling, leading to a self fulfilling prophecy where the price **does** move down and the hedge fund can profit.

If the liquidity risk of short selling was priced in, hedge funds would not be able to exert such large downward price pressure. Their manipulation would be too expensive because the fees demanded by share owners would be far greater than they are right now.

#Candidate Solution

If we are to accurately price liquidity risk into investing, I think it necessitates maintaining the invariant that only 100% of shares can be in existence. It sounds weird to have to say that, but evidently it's not a given. We have created a market that permits more shares to be owned than exist, and I don't think that's sustainable or equitable.

People like to point to Enron and other companies that would not have been accurately priced without short sales. I think this is the wrong takeaway. The correct takeaway is not, ""short sales are necessary."" Instead it's, ""downward price pressure instruments are necessary."" It does not have to be structured as a share lending program to have the same effect.

Here are the salient traits of a short sale, as I see them:

* There are shares owned by investor A in some security S.
* There is some investor B who expects the price of security S to decrease, thus they want to take the opposite position of investor A.
* Investor A is confident in the value of their investment, so they are willing to commit to holding their position on security S for an extended period of time.
* Investor B not only wants to profit off of a potential downward price movement in security S, they want to **exert downward pressure immediately** on the price to express their position in the market (as opposed to just buying a put option, which is speculation that does not have as direct or immediate an effect on the price).
* Investor B goes to investor A and says ""I want to put downward pressure on security S using your shares. In exchange, I will give you a guaranteed fee. This means we will enter a contract together w/r/t your shares of security S. For the duration of that period, you will not be able to modify your position w/r/t the shares of security S attached to this contract. At the end of the period, you will be made whole.""

These traits do naturally imply a lending program, where investor A lends their shares in security S to investor B (who then sells them on the market, applying downward price pressure, resolving at the end of the contract with the shares being returned to investor A). But they could also be structured as a futures contract!

The futures contract would be very similar to a short sale. It would look like the following: Investor A is long on security S. Investor B wants to take a short position on security S and apply immediate downward price pressure on security S. Investor B signs a contract with investor A. This contract stipulates...

* Investor B must immediately give investor A a fee for the contract.
* Investor B must wait the duration of the contract, at which point they must go to the market and buy the number of shares in security S that are attached to the contract.
* Investor B must give those shares to investor A.

It also stipulates...

* Investor A must immediately sell their shares in security S at the market price, which applies a downward price pressure on security S, for which they receive a fee from investor B.
* Investor A must hold on to the cash they received from the sale for the duration of the contract.
* At the end of the contract, investor A must give the cash they received from the sale of their security S shares to investor B.

Investor B gets to pay investor A for downward price pressure, investor B gets a guaranteed future sale of security S at the market price investor A sold the shares for, and investor A gets a fee in exchange for locking up their position in security S.

So then how does this differ from short selling?

The difference comes from the associated risk. Both investor A and investor B are taking on a price risk, whether it's a short sale or a futures contract. If the price goes up, investor A wins. If the price goes down, investor B wins. But a short sale does not account for liquidity risk. A futures contract, on the other hand, does!

When investor A sells their shares and holds the cash for the duration of the short sale, the are maintaining their long position via the futures contract. They will eventually get those shares back for the same price they sold them at, no matter what the price is in the future. Their position is unchanged, and they receive a fee. However, since they sold their shares, both investor A and investor B took on a liquidity risk! If, at the end of the futures contract, there are no shares available to cover, investor A keeps the cash they sold the shares for **and** the associated fee, but they *do not* receive their shares back.

In that scenario, where no shares are available, investor B loses their guaranteed sale at the higher price, because they are incapable of covering. This may lead to them having a reduced credit rating, being sent to some form of collections, or some other repercussions.

The net result of this system is that **at no point in time** are more or less than 100% of shares owned by anyone at all. Shares do not need to be borrowable. We can make that illegal. And a futures contract of this form could serve the exact same purpose while also accurately pricing liquidity risk, preventing hedge funds from being able to run stocks into the ground.

Does such a futures contract exist already? If so, what is it called? Do you think it would serve as a more equitable solution to fill the needs of investors that want to exert downward price pressure?

I'd love to hear your thoughts!

Note: Data is only reported on a bi-weekly basis, with the most recent data being from this Wednesday. Many data companies like S3 and ORTEX can only speculate. From what I read on his twitter, their algos somehow try to predict how much is being covered based on how the stock loan interest % changes. This week it dropped significantly to &lt;30% I believe, meaning that there is less associated risk with their shorts, which somehow correlates to how many have been covered within the volume Wednesday-Friday

Is their speculation wrong? How does it compare to ORTEX? Have they given in to Citadel? Discuss";stocks
rockstar-;1612135622;l9p01a;32;Potential Risk of a Liquidity Crisis;"DISCLAIMER: By no means am I a financial expert, this is all my own speculation and theory of what could happen as a result of the current events revolving around GME and other heavily shorted stocks.

Hello! I've been a lurker since the infamous crash of March 2020 and after seeing what has happened with GME these past few weeks, I do have to say that this is PHENOMENAL!

As most of us know by now, many brokers limited or completely stopped the buying of high volatility stocks such as GME, AMC, NOK, etc. At first I thought this was a manipulative tactic as brokers tried to limit the buying of a stock to help hedge funds save their asses and while this may be true in some cases (RH working with Citadel), I do think there is a deeper underlying issue at hand. 

On the news, [Interactive Brokers](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/28/interactive-brokers-restricted-gamestop-trading-to-protect-the-market-says-chairman-peterffy.html) said that they restricted trades to ""save the market"", many of us think ""saving the market"" is saving hedge funds or themselves, but I believe that in reality there is a potential risk of a liquidity crisis where the clearing house system won't be able to settle the massive amounts of trades and will have to resort to their reserve equity to cover these payments if need be. 

For those who do not know, the clearing house is the trusted transfer of securities and funds between the buyer and the seller. Some brokers are self-clearing while others resort to a third-party for settling trades. RH for example, is self-clearing, and recently they had to raise $1 billion to increase their ability to clear and execute trades in these volatile stocks. 

In an article posted on 2017 called [""What if a clearinghouse fails?""](https://www.brookings.edu/research/what-if-a-clearinghouse-fails/) it states that if a clearing house itself topples, the Dodd-Frank Act (enacted in 2010 to establish market stability) allows regulators to designate a clearing house as systematically important and provides a source of emergency funding. I think we are at this stage as we see brokers like RH reaching out for funding in order to be able to settle the trades in their clearing house. However, this is a very big weakness as there is no specific blueprint for failure. For example, what if instead of one clearing house failing, there are 5 or more? Do they all become ""systematically important"" and eligible for emergency funding? I highly doubt it.

Failure of a major clearinghouse could paralyze large swaths of the financial markets. While there are methods to save a clearing house from defaulting, there is still a massive risk if the whole system collapses. Which is why numerous brokers placed restrictions to prevent something like this from happening. 

While I do think part of their decision was quite manipulative, I think there is evidence to a potential liquidity crisis that **may not be here just yet**, but due to the recent events with GME and other stocks, we will begin to see a change in the market through an increase of volatility. 

Again this is pure speculation and my current outlook of the situation, there could be great opportunity ahead of us as we squeeze the living hell out of these hedge funds! Be safe and I hope everything goes well with you all in the next weeks with GME.

**TLDR:** Clearing houses are at risk of a liquidity crisis as our trades squeeze the living hell out of the salty hedge funds crying to their mammas about their dumb plays.";stocks
turkeychicken;1612134623;l9onsl;10;Have you checked your Sector Diversification lately?;"We've all heard that diversification is one of the key elements to a good portfolio.  I like to check my sector diversification every now and then to make sure i'm not too overloaded in one sector.

My brokerage uses the sector diversification stats from the S&amp;P 500 Global BMI which are as follows:

Sector | Percent
----------|----------:
Communication Services | 8.5%
Consumer Discretionary | 12.9%
Consumer Staples | 7.0%
Energy | 2.9%
Financials | 13.5%
Health Care | 11.9%
Industrials | 11.0%
Information Technology | 20.7%
Materials | 5.3%
Real Estate | 3.4%
Utilities | 2.9%

About the S&amp;P Global BMI:

&gt; The S&amp;P Global Broad Market Index (BMI) is the only global index suite with a transparent, modular structure that has been fully float adjusted since 1989. This comprehensive, rules-based index series employs a transparent and consistent methodology across all countries and includes more than 11,000 stocks from 25 developed and 25 emerging markets.

Just because this is the makeup of the S&amp;P Global BMI, it doesn't mean this is the golden rule in diversification.  It's just one way to see how your portfolio diversification is doing.

I can find these stats in Schwab by clicking on Portfolio Performance -&gt; Schwab Portfolio Checkup -&gt; Sector Diversification.  I'm sure Vanguard, Fidelity, TD, etc have a similar report but I don't know where that would be.

How does your diversification compare to the above percentages? I'll post my portfolio's diversification in the comments below.";stocks

t_mello_;1612146891;l9sncu;42;Telos (TLS) cybersecurity company;"
With Telos options finally coming available about 2 weeks ago I decided I should make this post to see what everyone thinks. 

Some background info:
Telos is a cybersecurity company that recently completed its IPO on November 19, 2020. The IPO price was $17.00 but it opened around $20. 

**What do they do**: Telos is an information technology company focused on designing and providing customers with secure solutions that leverage mobile communication, cloud technology, and collaboration. Its customer base consists primarily of military, intelligence and civilian agencies of the federal government and NATO allies around the world. 

So basically cybersecurity using the cloud for HUGE companies/military/government. You can see their list of clients on the website but it includes: 

DOD, Department of State ,AWS, Microsoft Azure, Department of Homeland Security, FedEx, Verizon, Citi 

Not thinking they're going to 0 any time soon with that customer base.

**Valuation**

Now let's compare their numbers to one of the top MEME stonks of the year: PLTR.

**TLS : $219M (2019)** 

**PLTR: $739M (2019)** 

Yes, Palantir has 3X more, but look at valuation: 

**TLS : $2.2B**

**PLTR: $66B** 

Palantir has 3X the revenue but 33X the market cap. Definitely room for growth. Revenue also increased 20% YOY for the first 9 Months of 2020. They have 350+ customers and 85% of revenue is recurring.

They both had similar earnings last quarter with Telos at -0.01/share and PLTR +0.05. Analyst estimates are slowly increasing with 2021 earnings expected to be positive ($0.26/Share). While analysts are steadily downgrading Palantir to Hold/Underperform/Sell, Telos recommendations are Buy or Strong Buy across the board. 

**Market for Cybersecurity**: The total addressable market in 2019 was $156.5B in 2019, with a 10% Compound Annual Growth Rate. This means it should approximately double by 2027. I believe this is underestimating the growth. Since the pandemic, people have been forced to work from home, and many functions that could be done at the office are now being done remotely. This means a lot more security risk since almost everything is being done online, and it is harder to secure everyones personal computers than to secure a controlled work site. 

**Price:** It hovered around $20 but has been steadily growing over the last month or so, it hit $41.84/share but is currently sitting around 35. A lot of price targets are for $45/share. I believe it can go much higher than that based on the numbers provided, and the increase in cybersecurity requirements. It has almost no hype since IPO but slow steady price growth. Just look at all the threads on PLTR here, plus PLTR has 87k watchers on twits. TLS is relatively unknown with 1200 watchers. I feel like as soon as people realize what this company is doing, it will take off to the moon. Plus the implied volatility is 81% vs 129% for PLTR, so when you can buy long dated options cheaper.

Investingwifey;1612145592;l9s8os;20;TRXC - investment thesis;"Transenterix (TRXC)

This is a small medical device company that makes a robotic surgical system called the senhance system.  This is a system used for robotic assisted laparoscopic surgery allowing surgeons to perform surgery with small incisions, less tissue manipulation, increased control and less surgical variability.  

While robotics in surgery may seem like expensive toys, there are several reasons to consider their adoption amongst surgeons.  Firstly, surgery often involves long hours of standing and use of the surgeon’s hands which can cause fatigue, surgical robots would reduce this.  Secondly, surgical robots can largely replace surgical assistants thereby reducing surgical costs. Thirdly, surgeons during traditional laparoscopic instruments are allowed limited access by their instruments, robots are not limited in this way as articulations can be added to instruments to facilitate surgical access.  

The largest and best known company in this space is intuitive surgical (ISRG) who makes the DaVinci surgical robotic system.  This system has an installed base of approximately 5000 units as of 2020.  Which vastly outnumbers the number of senhance systems installed by transenterix, however there remains, in my opinion, significant room for growth as robotics in surgery has not yet been widely adopted in many regions.  However, progressive forward looking surgical training programs will likely start incorporating training with surgical robots thus bolstering demand amongst graduating surgeons.  These surgeons will likely request the same instruments they used as residents and having already trained with them they will feel comfortable sticking with what they learnt on. 

I have 2 main bull cases for this stock:

	1.	l see a large runway for robotic surgery in general.  As new surgeons are trained they will be looking to robotic assisted surgery to improve patient care.  I believe transenterix could be positioned to capitalize on this.

	2.	With a market capitalization of $364 million, while not the screaming deal it was even 3 months ago, may represent a reasonable value.  This company has a fully functioning robotics system which has been approved for use in the USA, and has just received clearance for use throughout the Russian federation and in Japan. 

The bear case:

	1.	Transenterix is a relatively small company which is competing with companies with much higher market capitalizations and much more money at their disposal such as intuitive surgical and Medtronic.  Once surgeons learn to use one device it may be hard for them to switch.

	2.	It has become somewhat of a hot stock recently resulting in a significant run up in price.  I often get concerned when prices run up this quickly that they often drop again to a more reasonable level.  Furthermore the company is not yet profitable. 

In summary, TRXC is an interesting company in a very interesting space.  They have fully functional surgical robots with reusable components, unlike most of their competitors which may make them more attractive.  The price was a definite bargain only a few months ago but the recent price run up makes it less so, although at this share price the company has issued more shares to give further liquidity for further operations.  

I am long And this is not financial advice 


TLDR: Robotic assisted surgery is in its infancy.  I see a long runway for this domain.  Just as ultrasound was once new tech and price prohibited wide spread adoption but eventually became standard of care in many specialties I see robotics taking the same path in surgery.";stocks
issafuego;1612145436;l9s6wl;10;Visualizing Google Searches for stocks in a US Large Caps Universe;"Hey everyone,

I made a graph to illustrate the related queries between Google Searches for stocks in a US Large Caps Universe.

Although the goal was only for visualization purposes, the graph can be downloaded/viewed in full size here if you're curious: https://www.flickr.com/photos/191972133@N07/50896273292/

The graph represents the tickers linked to each other ticker. The font size of a ticker corresponds to its number of appearances in the linked searches of other tickers (that's why you'll see directionnal arrows in the graph. For instance; AAPL might appear as a related search for ABBV, but ABBV might not appear as a related search for AAPL). 
Also, the market cap data used was ~one week old, so unfortunately GME (🌎🚀) is not included for those who might ask.

I found it quite impressive to see that the interest of individuals appears to be concentrated around a few stocks, and I wanted to share it with you !

thesearcher22;1612141080;l9qsg2;2;Wash Sales;"Is there any good guide that anyone has found regarding wash sales, a/k/a the rule that keeps you from claiming a loss? 

The rule reads pretty cut and dry: if you buy a stock or option and sell it at a loss and within 30 days you then buy substantially the same security or option, even an option of a different date and strike, then you cannot claim the initial loss. [https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091#:\~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20any,or%20by%20an%20exchange%20on](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/1091#:~:text=In%20the%20case%20of%20any,or%20by%20an%20exchange%20on)

That still leaves some lack of clarity or room for different interpretations. If I read that as unbending as possible, then if I trade SPY options every day and close out every day, and out of 100 trades, 30 losers bring losses of 15K and 70 winners bring gains of 40K, then I cannot claim those losses of 15K to make my total 25K, and instead my total taxable amount is the 40K. That would wreck many daytraders.

But this changes when I look at the purpose of the rule, where wikipedia gives more context. You are not allowed to sell just to take a loss and then immediately repurchase with a lower basis. Instead, the meaning of not being allowed to take the loss means that the loss is added to the cost basis of the replacement stock (buy at 47, sell at 43, buy at 38--your basis in the new stock is 38 + 4 = 42), and you get your ownership time period in the initial stock as your holding time period--that is, they get added together. The IRS views it as just a pause. 

When viewed with this larger context, it appears that this rule would really not impact daytraders at all, because you are quickly out of the new trade as well. I am also thinking of it as it impacts my other trades. For example, I like AMZN as a daytrading options vehicle and as a long-term holding vehicle. So if trade it regularly with options, and take some losses, and if these rules extend across all accounts as I have read, then that would seem to indicate that a monthly purchasing plan within a retirement account would mean that you cannot take the losses from your daytrading on AMZN options. 

Does anyone have any better guide on this that makes this clearer with good sources? Thanks!";Daytrading

I believe it has the same if not more potential this time around with what can possibly be happening. Stock is currently trading just under $15, so we are talking almost a 10x. It is also now finally over the superguppy indicator, which happened last time as well. My PT on this is $135

Solar, wind, biofuels, and recycling petroleum byproducts.

OEG recently closed an offering worth 35M, are debt free, profitable, and looking to expand into energy storage and 5G services as well. They had a big announcement a few days ago, a partnership with Akon’s Black Sunrise Fund for $700M starting, leading to $1B to decomission old coal plants to produce solar farms. I know all hype is on these short squeezes at the moment but I definitely sniff an opportunity here while the market is down.

Their ATH is in the 30s. It hit 3.26 on Friday before pulling back to just under $3. What sets it differently now is that they had their phase 3 Stem Cell Mobilization trial halted EARLY because of the significant results seen by their regulators.

TheNightleaf;1612148394;l9t3wy;23;Silver mining companies are heavily leveraged to the price of silver...;"... and since the spot price of silver itself is evidently increasing, in part due to the fine work of the community here, I thought it would be prudent to notify those who may be interested in making some extra money on the side, of an under-the-radar investment opportunity that I myself have taken a position in. I will explain: 

Aurcana Silver Corporation (AUN.V) is a near-term silver producer that has 100% ownership of the world's highest-grade silver mine (proven &amp; probable reserves, 21 million ounces at 37 ounces per ton), the Revenue-Virginius mine in Ouray, Colorado, USA. The company is lead by CEO Ken Drover, who has 40 years of experience in the mining industry, and who previously served as Vice President of Worldwide Operations with Kinross Gold, an $11 billion (CAD) senior gold mining company. On January 27th, Aurcana closed their significantly oversubscribed private placement for proceeds of C$34,500,000, priced at C$1.00 per share, turning down an additional $15,000,000 of offered capital. This capital will be used to assist in the restart of the company's Revenue Virginius Mine, as well as resource expansion (the company retains significant exploration upside in addition to their existing resource). This fully-permitted mine will also be one of the lowest-cost silver producers in the world at only US$8/oz Ag (AISC) after byproduct credits. Aurcana's last closing price was C$0.92, with a market cap of only C$219M, providing a great opportunity for silver investors to leverage a fully-funded, near-term producer that is exceptionally well-positioned to grow with the coming commodity boom, which silver will be at the forefront of.

Silver is not just a precious metal and hedge against inflation, it is (without exaggeration) the world's foremost technology metal, with the best electrical and thermal conductivity of all the metals, used in industrial fabrication, including electrical applications such as conductors, switches, contacts and fuses, and absolutely essential in the production of consumer electronics (mobile devices, computers, appliances etc), the automotive industry (especially electric vehicles), telecom infrastructure (5G), solar panels, and much more. All of this silver that is required to build the future has to come from somewhere, and Aurcana is just one example of several great silver companies, including Pan American Silver, Wheaton, Hecla Mining, First Majestic, and Discovery Metals, but I feel that Aurcana in particular has been overlooked, and is the underrated ""dark horse"" of the pack, with potentially more upside, given its relatively tiny market cap in comparison to the other mentioned companies. 

Anyways, you get the idea. I think this is worth sharing, and paints a pretty clear picture.  Do your own research and decide what you think.";StockMarket
Galdimaster;1612137823;l9pqcj;4;Due Diligence - My Resons for Going Long in Blackberry;"I know that last week was a bit on the turbulent side for BB. I decided to double-check my original BB DD, as a way to remind myself of why I invested in the first place. From my point of view, nothing has changed in the fundamentals, and I am still very well satisfied with my investment.

Currently, I have 410 stocks, with an average buy-in of $17,62 per stock.

Before getting down to the good stuff, I just want to point out that **this is in no way financal advice**, neither do I take any responsibility for your financial choices based on my text. I'm just your average happy amateur.

**THE PHONE COMPANY THAT SWITCHED TO IoT AND CYBER SECURITY**

For starters, you can't really exclusively call Blackberry a phone company anymore. They've switched their main focus to Cyber Security and IoT. Today, BB provides solutions for Unified Endpoint Security, Penetration Testing, Ransomware Protection and Blackberry QNX (remember that last one, because it's important).

In December of 2020, a massive attack occured against SolarWinds, a major IT firm that provides software for entities ranging from Fortune 500 companies to the US government. The US agencies in question that got attacked were: parts of the Pentagon, the Department of Homeland Security, the State Department, the Department of Energy, the National Nuclear Security Administration, and the Treasury.

However, **not a single of BlackBerry's customers were affected by the hack**.

**BLACKBERRY QNX**

Blackberry owns and develops the closed source QNX operating system, which is a real-time operating system (meaning that it can process data without buffer delays). If you have a smartphone or a car, chances are that in one way or another, it runs with QNX embedded.

Read more about QNX [here](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/company/newsroom/press-releases/2019/blackberry-qnx-software-now-embedded-in-more-than-150-million-vehicles).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH BAIDU, XPENG and GAC GROUP: EV-INDUSTRY IN CHINA**

Just like in other developed parts of the world, it's springtime for the electrical vehicle-market in China. You might have heard about some of their most successful brands: NIO, BAIDU, XPENG and GAC group.

NIO has a market cap of **$61.6 bn**, XPENG has a market cap of **$31.5 bn**, Baidu has a market cap of **$80,16**, and GAC group has a market cap of a whooping **$114,7 bn**.

Why is this good for Blackberry?

1. In August 2020, BB announced that they will be *""powering the Level 3 driving domain controller of Xpeng""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
2. A couple of weeks ago, BB announced that they would deepen their partnership with Chinese GAC Group, who amongst other things make electric cars. I read an article from a couple of days ago claiming that *""Future GAC electric cars will get BlackBerry driving assistance technology""* using... you guessed it! **QNX!**
3. Since April 2019, GAC group and NIO (the other EV maker) has had a joint venture in the form of the brand ""Hycan"", an electric car manufacturer. It's not farfetched to believe that there is a good chance of the Hycans to have QNX embedded as well.

Read more [here](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/blackberry-expands-partnership-with-baidu-to-power-next-generation-autonomous-driving-technology-301211498.html).

**PARTNERSHIP WITH AMAZON**

As you all probably already know, Amazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud platform company. BlackBerry recently partnered with Amazon Web Services (AWS) to launch a new connected vehicle platform that merges BlackBerry's QNX operating system with AWS's IoT services.

AWS launched its IoT platform in 2015. At the time, Amazon stated that it would make it easier for developers to create apps that link to myriad IoT gadgets, including smart speakers, home appliances, wearables, and connected cars. AWS is already the world's top cloud platform, so it makes perfect sense to integrate its IoT service into the most widely used embedded operating system for connected cars.

By linking QNX to the cloud, automakers can instantly monitor a vehicle's EV battery levels and vehicle subsystems, provide over-the-air software updates, and personalize vehicle cockpits,  advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and machine learning models for autonomous driving through cloud-based apps.

This reinforces BlackBerry's market-dominating position in embedded operating systems for connected cars, which also circles back to BB's endevours on the Chinese EV-market.

**PROJECT KUIPER**

I want to warn you all that this next part is purely speculation on my part.

From Wikipedia:  **Kuiper Systems LLC** is a subsidiary of Amazon that was set up in 2019 to deploy a large broadband satellite internet constellation to provide broadband internet connectivity. The deployment is also referred to by its project name ""**Project Kuiper**"". Amazon announced that it would be investing $10 billion in this project to deploy the satellite internet constellation.

How could BB fit into this thing?

Well, here's my hypothesis:

Why would Amazon start a long-term partnership with BlackBerry? Well, because BlackBerry has competency that Amazon lacks in-house of course. If Amazon wants to send satellites to space, why wouldn't they use Blackberry, when QNX has already been used in rockets by NASA and SpaceX?

Although there isn't any concrete evidence for my claims about BB and Project Kuiper, I personally don't believe that my thougts are way ""out there"". I guess time will tell if I'm right, but it's what I'm betting on!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR:

* BB's QNX operating system could become huge during 2021 due to BB's involvement with Amazon and Chinese EV-manufacturers.
* BB could play an important part in Project Kuiper";StockMarket
TheNihilistKitten;1612147268;l9srl1;26;RobinHood and Citadel did't commit market manipulation with regard to GME.;"Posting this because I think a lot of people are misguided (but not invalid) in where they're directing they're anger.

RobinHood stopped letting people buy GME because the clearinghouse increased the margins on them. The clearinghouse increased margins because they worried they'd get blamed for letting a bubble grow, like they were during the '08 recession.

The Citadel side is a lot simpler: Citadel made borrowing fees and transaction fees on everyone who bought GME. Preventing GME trades were the LAST thing they wanted to occur.

People who think some broad conspiracy happened here to prevent them from screwing over hedge funds don't realize no one on Wall Street or within finance really like hedge funds. They're competitors: the finance world wants them to die.

\[EDIT\] When I originally posted this elsewhere, someone said they think anyone who doesn't believe what I'm saying is a moron. Let me just say I DON'T agree with that. Most people have no idea how some of the complexities work, nor should they. A lot of things prevent them from being able to understand these things, including the exact people who benefit off their ignorance. If you're pissed that you were all behind GME and then no one explained to you why you couldn't buy, I don't blame you. Hell, I'd be pissed too. I'm not trying to defend these firms. Fuck em. But a lot of the misunderstanding behind this is going to drive misunderstanding of how people respond to this.";StockMarket
ceryus1;1612142182;l9r5j6;18;Would Hedge Funds Intentionally Crash the Market???;"So with everything involving GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc., and the continued press about a market crash, I started thinking, ""What would hedge fund managers do in order to regain their position?"" and I came up with a thought that I'd like to share.

Mind you I'm a novice, I've been learning about investing, stocks, and everything else over the past year so if someone is able to shed some light on or discuss why or why not this scenario would play out, please educate me.

So we know the story, GME moons, hedgies are eating shit because of their short positions and everyone here with diamond hands won't sell until those rockets are in the Andromeda galaxy. We start hearing from the media that Melvin already covered their position, but simultaneously that GME's situation will cause a market crash. Well, how could that happen if they've covered their position? Unless more shorts are put on the stock and the squeeze happens as planned. So my question is if you were a hedge fund why would you not continue pushing the market crash narrative, not to scare us into selling, after all we're all retards riding this ship to the moon, but for the boomers to take their money out to save themselves from the impending crash. Couldn't a hedge fund with the resources available begin closing positions in the market to cover for GME losses causing prices to fall market wide. Use the media to plant the story of a market crash to instill fear. Bet on the market falling as boomers take money out causing prices to dive lower. Then in the aftermath, when prices are down, go back into positions around the market when everything is dirt cheap. The media will vilify us as the catalyst for the crash and nothing will change on Wall Street.

Granted they'll lose money on GME when the squeeze does happen but why would this scenario not be advantageous for them to do? Also with that in mind as an investor, understanding the sway these people have over the market, wouldn't the smart move be to close positions and ride the crash to the bottom and scoop up those shares at value prices?

Again, I'm learning here but I know these fools on Wall Street don't give a shit. They will gladly crash the market while betting against it to prove a point that they're better than us in the long term and not give two fucks about any casualties of the crash. Maybe I'm a moron though and this is totally incomprehensible. If so, can someone discuss why or why not along with discussing what the long game would be.

Also for full disclosure, I am holding both GME and AMC until I can take a shit on Mars.";StockMarket
phillypros007;1612139151;l9q69f;2;Your (1) share matters! How r/wallstreetbets could theoretically hold 10% of $GME shares outstanding (can someone post this in WSB? I can't);"First I want to say **CONGRATULATIONS RETARDS** for what you've achieved and for getting the **ENTIRE WORLD** to *pay attention*.

I'm not a financial advisor, just a retarded day trader with paper hands but I currently own 5 GME shares @ 360/avg...I've flipped in and out a few times during the past 2 weeks for lunch money (which I then used to buy lunch for my wife's boyfriend). I want to hold until $1000 but I'll prob sell 4 shares for a $100 profit, because of what I mentioned above \^\^\^...BUT I WILL HOLD 1 SHARE FOREVER

&amp;#x200B;

* Why? Because, together we can be a SUPERORGANISM (not orgasm) -

&gt;"" **Contemporary research has instead revealed that swarms of birds, fish, and insects are in fact leaderless systems more akin to a single living organism than a mere collection of individuals"" "" Indeed, the degree of unity achieved by some societies of social insects – such as army ants, weaver ants, termites, and honeybees – is so great that many sociobiologists characterize them as “superorganisms**.” - [***https://www.metanexus.net/swarms-colonies-flocks-and-schools-exploring-ontology-collective-individuals/***](https://www.metanexus.net/swarms-colonies-flocks-and-schools-exploring-ontology-collective-individuals/)

&amp;#x200B;

* So what is my retarded point? If everyone holds one share forever, the math doesn't lie -**7.5mil retards (currently subscribed to WSB) / 69.75mil shares outstanding = 10.75%\*\*\***  

* The media thinks this will blow over. They can't wait until GME goes back to $20/share. BUT IF YOU WANT TO BE A PART OF SOMETHING BIGGER THAN YOURSELF AND NOT A FLAVOR OF THE WEEK, WE ALL HOLD 1 SHARE FOREVER. WHO KNOWS, MAYBE GAMESTOP WILL PAY DIVIDENDS ONE DAY, AND WE CAN COLLECT PASSIVE INCOME LIKE ~~BOOMERS~~ RETARDS.  

* GameStop will probably offer shares eventually but that is to be expected. They are going to have SO MUCH CASH and can COMPLETELY TRANSFORM their business. I am personally excited to watch it unfold. BUT WE ALL NEED TO HOLD 1 SHARE MINIMUM.

  


TLDR - HOLD 1 SHARE FOREVER

Wheaties_With_Water;1612145626;l9s92e;2;Looking to interview an experienced investor or trader for a school project;"Hello, at my high school we are all required to create a capstone/passion project on a subject that we are interested. This interview would consist of 15-20 basic questions. Thank you! 



Well since there is a 560 word requirement and I need this project in order to graduate I suppose I'll speak about my own experiences with the stock market. For about my entire life my family has struggled financially. Due to various reasons we have stayed fairly poor. When I was a freshman in 2017 my older brother, who was a senior at the time, introduced me to Robert Kiyosaki's 'Rich Dad, Poor, Dad' and talked to me about the importance of financial literacy. He told me about how the book changed his perspective and how we should gain a desire to get rich to escape poverty. I read the book and it changed everything. I never looked at things the same and it was almost strange how a single book could change so much to the point where I thought differently altogether. I tried to read more books in general on finance but I didn’t understand them enough. It was a little tough to find books that were easy for me to understand because it was all so fresh. I started randomly studying terms on quizlet to learn more. After a couple months I stumbled across “The Elements of Investing” by Charles D. Ellis. This book was very simple and had ideas I could get behind. I liked learning about the stock market and was extremely eager to invest. By the end of my sophomore year I started working at Chick-fil-A. I saved up almost every penny I earned. By the beginning of junior year I felt that I was finally ready to start investing so I pestered my father to help me open a custodial account. All I could really find was this app called Stockpile which seemed that it’s main attraction was UGMA/UTMA custodial accounts. They also offered partial shares which peaked my interest because my first investment was in Amazon. I purchased a fractional share when it was at around $1700 I believe. I put in $1000 and was ecstatic. I would check the prices every period waiting for the slightest movement. I also invest in visa or MasterCard I can’t remember which but that was only for a few weeks. I used to watch Financial Education Jeremy on YouTube and he posted his monthly video of stocks he was buying. One of his stocks was National beverage company (FIZZ) so Invested when it was at around $45 I think. A couple months later and I saw that E*TRADE also had a custodial account available however, if required an existing account to create a new one. I convinced him to make one and I could also use it and he did. I sold out all of my shares from stockpile for a gain of $70 or so. On E*TRADE I made my first options trade on GME. It was a put on their earnings. I expected them to tank. I barely had enough knowledge to execute the play. I bought a put contract for about $85 and waited. Before earnings the stock tanked badly. I was up like 40% or so. I got a little nervous so I just sold before the end of the day. I made some more trades, some winning, some losing, and expanded my knowledge of trading on reddit. Right before the Rona crash I was holding NKE calls and they absolutely tanked. I lost a ton of money and I felt horrible inside. I made a couple more trades and made some small profits. I finally invested in Toll brothers TOL and bought some long term calls that expired the next year. This was in April or May. I held this one call and it blew up. I made 75% of what I had lost in the crash. I was so happy. Throughout 2020 I worked a ton and got great hours. I saved everything I could. I continued to trade and overall broke even. I stopped trading risky OTM options joined theta gang instead. I made a few plays with cash secured puts but haven’t really touched my account since December. That is all, if you can help me, thank you very much!!!";StockMarket
Butthoarder;1612143429;l9rjng;9;Am i being scammed;"I recently was contacted by a company called CashTucker and they wanted to know if i wanted to invest in their brand new bank. It all seems real except they want me to pay by Venmo which is suspicious? Can anyone help? 

I have personally talked to the man who owns it. He’s either a really good liar or telling the truth. They have an instagram but that is their only social media presence I know of and it is fairly new. This is not something i would go for but the opportunity is too good to not at least question. 

I would also like to point out the idea of something being too good to be true is very prevalent here.";StockMarket
liverly;1612142621;l9radb;21;Too late to change brokerage services?;Because Robinhood is participating in market manipulation, has a very uncertain future, and generally sucks ass, i don’t trust the service any longer and I want to transfer positions from Robinhood to fidelity. Yes, it includes GME and several other popular and volatile stocks right now. I know the short squeeze is coming, but it could be another week. If I initiated the transfer process tomorrow, is it too late? I don’t want my volatile positions in limbo for the whole week, this is all so touch and go. I already have a fidelity account and use it for mutual fund investment. TIA!;StockMarket
Framesjanco11;1612134055;l9ogpl;22;Anybody familiar with the SOFI app?;"Howdy, I’m another retail investor eventually looking to get off of Robinhood in light of recent events. I know of a few other platforms I could take my money to, but don’t really know how any other ones are. In all honesty, if Robinhood hadn’t done what they did and expose themselves as either corrupt or wildly incompetent, I would have recommended it to anyone who asked because of how accessible it is.

I saw an ad for SOFI, as they wisely decided to pay for some promoted tweets during this whole mess. Does anyone here use it and can tell me how it is, or maybe recommend other platforms?";StockMarket

Do not get discouraged by the all the news. Just because Robinhood banned GME does not stop you from holding. You can still buy on other platforms. Lets send GME and AMC through the roof. Wall street has not learned their lesson, lets really stick it to them. We are in space but lets take it to the moon next! And than Mars and other new heights! The community is growing, more people are waking up to this. The last few days should encourage everyone to get a trading account. There are free brokerage accounts out there.

PlutoPluto88;1612143800;l9ro1u;31;What Should I Invest In?;Hello, I’m a 13 year old who aspires to have a job in Wall Street some day. This sounds cringe because you may think I just got into stocks because of the GameStop stocks going up, no. I’ve wanted to work with stocks for a while ago. Now you may wonder why I’m worried about this at such a young age. Well personally I’m someone who likes spending money and having nice things, so I know that I have to be really smart now so that I can be happy when I’m older and be able to set myself up for a nice future (401k, savings, and more). So I guess the premise of this message is what can I do to start making money off of stocks. I really have about $100 to start so I’m going to need recommendations for cheaper shares. I already have a couple of books coming in the mail to help me as well. Thank you for reading this, I appreciate it, have a good day.;StockMarket
ortizj1044;1612136602;l9pbm8;38;Gamestop worth buying currently?;I was wondering if gamestop is worth buying right now while it is currently over 300 dollars, Should I wait a few days and then buy or will it continue to rise? I want to get in before its too late, but I also worry about getting in and then it just drops. Also could there be another stock like gamestop in the near future that we can get to the moon again? Or should I stick with AMC and Blackberry currently because of how much GME is? Any thoughts ? I don’t have too much money I am worth risking so I would only be able to buy one or two shares of gamestop, is it even worth it or should I just hope the same thing can happen to AMC or BB.;StockMarket
spencercoffman;1612146291;l9sglr;24;"Hold Short Squeezed Stocks &amp; Buy Silver!";"The price of silver is rising right along with crypto and other stocks. There is much more going on than meets the eye. 

Over the past several weeks short squeezed stocks have been going up and big hedge funds have been losing money. Exchanges limited trading of certain stocks. Why? Because they are friendly with the hedge funds. 

What’s the next step? Keep buying and holding all of the short squeezed stocks. 

Stocks like GME, AMC, NOK, &amp; NAKD

Also, start buying silver. Silver is becoming a hot commodity. Most retail stores don’t have it. In addition, the price of an ounce of silver on eBay went from $25 to over $40 on January 31!

Get out there and buy at least 4 ounces of silver as soon as you can. Also, it may be a good idea to buy SLV on your favorite stock exchange.

This silver hype is most likely a product of the hedge fund people trying to save themselves. Therefore, use the opportunity against them by buying silver on Monday. Then, when the price rises. Sell so that you can take your profits and buy more stocks that are heavily shorted.

Comment with your thoughts!";StockMarket
StockLawdMoon;1612142481;l9r8th;13;$VISL to 368$;"VISL is a company that produces satellites for remote communications. With the up coming hype of TSLA launching Star-link internet and Google producing their version of satellite based internet, I feel like Vislink could be a partner for Space X’s mission for deploying geosynchronous satellites into orbit. The space sector is a potential 1T dollar industry, not only that but VISL produces high real time streaming capabilities for drones, law enforcement, military and event uses such as football games. 

On top of all this information and the release of Cathy Woods ARK invest Space sector could have VISL as a potential Candidate.

The broking firm also lists Castor as the buyer of 2010-built Sanoyas kamsarmax Key Evolution for $15.25m. The vessel, sold by Japan’s Tokei Kaiun, is valued at $14.4m by VesseslsValue and if confirmed would become the first kamsarmax in the Castor fleet.""

This may have gone under the radar with all the hubbub surrounding GME but the significance of this contract cannot be overstated. 


The details of the contract are a little muddled at this time but it appears to be a seasonal contract, as in they Palantir software is only available to Girl Scouts of America during the summer months so they don’t have to be paying during the wintertime when they can’t fundraise anyway.


Downside: the price of cookies will probably go up astronomically.


Positions: GME 🚀 💎 👐";wallstreetbets
bigjaymck;1612141109;l9qsrq;191;I have a confession...;"First off, I am a very low level investor. A couple of weeks ago, I bought in to GME at around $36. Bought 10 shares as part of my ~$1500 portfolio. Got excited when it went up over 40, then scared when it dropped back down to a loss. I went all 📄👐 and set a trailing stop order, and ended selling my 10 shares at about $1 profit, happy that at least I didn't lose money.

The next day was the first it closed over $100. And it just kept going up. Eventually, I got back on board... Sold most of the rest of my portfolio and bought $1000 of GME for about 2.7 shares.

Im sorry I doubted you. Please forgive me, you beautiful bastards (and bastardettes). I have learned my lesson, and will be buying more GME once my account transfer from Robinhood (🖕RH) to Fidelity is complete. 💎👐 GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀!";wallstreetbets

## What Exactly Happened at Robinhood This Week?

There has been plenty of speculation this week about what exactly went down and unverified (although reasonable) rumors on why Robinhood did this. I’ll go over the top two theories before taking a deep dive into the “official” reason given by Robinhood.

[**Pressure from the White House and Sequoia according to a Robinhood employee**](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/l723kf/robinhood_insider_information/)

This statement has been [refuted by Sequoia](https://www.newsweek.com/sequoia-capitol-denies-pressuring-robinhood-stop-gamestop-trading-after-viral-reddit-post-1565269). I personally wouldn’t believe the Sequoia part since I don’t really know what they would gain from it - they’re a Venture Capital firm, not a hedge fund, and would not be actively shorting stocks let alone be trading in stocks. It could be possible that the White House, or someone from the government did contact Robinhood - actually, I’d be pretty shocked if no one called them at some point this week to ask wtf was going on.During this call, they may have been afraid that GameStop’s short squeeze would have triggered a major financial crisis due to hedge funds collapsing and de-grossing, causing a mass selloff similar to what was seen in 2008 and in March 2020 - I’ll talk more about this later. Basically, without Robinhood shutting down GME from being bought, it’s actually very possible we would have seen the rest of the stock market collapse last week, and this was something the Biden administration was trying to make sure didn’t happen in the first month in office.

**Possible intervention from Citadel Securities**

This was a theory I personally believed in initially and would have been a very obvious area of scrutiny for many people. The most straightforward one being the fact that Citadel (the hedge fund) dumped a few billion into Melvin to bail it out a [few days ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/citadel-point72-to-invest-2-75-billion-into-melvin-capital-management-11611604340), who were the very well known shorts of GME. Citadel, the hedge fund, is owned by Citadel LLC, which happens to also run Citadel Securities - a market maker. If you don’t know what this is, go grow a few brain wrinkles and read my [previous post about this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l5ygab/dddd_how_rwallstreetbets_created_a_financial/). Citadel Securities is effectively Robinhood’s sugar daddy, directly being responsible for around [40% of their revenue](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/18/a-controversial-part-of-robinhoods-business-tripled-in-sales-thanks-to-high-frequency-trading-firms.html) in 2018 through their payment for order flow (i.e. selling your trades to Citadel, giving them the right of first refusal, and [potentially giving you a worse price](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321); this is how they get 0% commission trades btw).

Theoretically, Citadel the hedge fund and Citadel the market maker is run independently and sister companies both owned by Citadel LLC, but anyone can see this being a potential conflict of interest. There’s also a possibility that Citadel Securities losing billions of dollars being short so many GME calls (they write 99% of all options contracts) and probably not being perfectly Gamma and (especially) Vega hedged, so when those two greeks skyrocketed on GME they probably lost tons of money there. [According to WSB hero Chamath](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354947541125611526), he didn’t invest in Robinhood when they came to him on multiple occasions because he thought the founders lacked integrity, implying he believes they might have been the type of people to sell out their users (granted, they already literally do this) and do this type of shit.

**The Official Reason - Clearing House Limitations**

Let’s get to the [official reason put out by Robinhood](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/28/an-update-on-market-volatility), which is that their clearing house, in this case the Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corp, suddenly increased their collateral requirements on GME trades drastically. Apparently, **Robinhood is running out of cash**, so they weren’t able to provide the cash collateral demanded by DTCC, and hence weren’t able to trade through them. Let’s dumb this down and talk about how brokerages work.

Let’s talk about what a clearing house is and how they work. Imagine Bob wants to sell Dylan a share of GME. There’s a bunch of legal paperwork and logistics for actually transferring over the share, which can take a few days to finalize - this is called settlement. However, you don’t want people being able to back out of this exchange during this process for obvious reasons, so that’s where the clearing house comes in. Let’s call this clearing house Mary. What Mary does is facilitate (clear) this exchange, and ensures both Bob and Dylan follow through with their trade by having them both immediately give Mary cash as collateral while the exchange settles. If one party was no longer able to meet their end of the exchange (eg. Dylan goes bankrupt), Mary acts as an insurer and is responsible for buying the share from Bob instead. If it turned out that Bob was lying about actually owning a share and can't transfer it over to Dylan in time (failure to deliver), Mary is responsible for finding that share for him instead.

Since GME suddenly became very volatile, and the financial soundness of some parties and their ability to deliver their side of the trade have been suddenly called into question ([at least on the seller’s side](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/)), DTCC decided  (...or due to pressure from other sources?) to increase the collateral needed for buying GME to be more than 10x of the proportion of the market value of whatever it was before. Most brokerages reacted to this by disabling margin trading. For some reason, Robinhood went one step further and disabled trading for all accounts, possibly due to their relatively small cash reserves compared to places like Fidelity, and the relatively large number of users who use margin in the platform.

## What’s Robinhood Going To Do About GME?

Robinhood’s decision to stop purchases of GME basically got hate from literally everyone, to the point where it somehow united the country in a beautiful way. Here’s a list of things that happened as a result of Robinhood’s decision, for fun

* [Ted Cruz retweeted AOC saying he completely agreed with her](https://twitter.com/tedcruz/status/1354833603943931905)
* [Protests at NYSE and Robinhood HQ](https://www.foxbusiness.com/markets/protesters-gather-at-robinhood-hq-nyse-in-response-to-restricted-stock-trades)
* [Class action lawsuit](https://www.cnn.com/2021/01/28/investing/lawsuit-robinhood-gamestop-wallstreetbets/index.html)
* [Someone paid to have an airplane](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8rlyx/this_guy_is_flying_a_banner_saying_suck_my_nuts/) fly around the Bay Area over Robinhood’s office saying “Suck my nuts Robinhood”
* [Angry Robinhood employees were given DoorDash credits for some reason?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7y5ka/robinhood_staff_unhappy_about_the_trading_hault/)
* [Congressional investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.businessinsider.com/robinhood-job-posting-federal-affairs-congress-hearing-gamestop-reddit-2021-1)
* [SEC investigation to Robinhood’s decision](https://www.cnet.com/news/robinhood-troubles-sec-will-closely-review-actions-that-restricted-amc-gamestop-stock-trades/)

Clearly, this decision has single-handedly made Robinhood the most hated company in the world right now. It’s especially bad given the optics - their mission is to literally “democratize finance”, with the idea of empowering individual retail investors to be on the same level of institutions. This decision, whether intentional or not, has literally gone against everything about Robinhood’s image and mission, and will end the company if not fixed soon. **All of this right as Robinhood is planning to launch their IPO**.

The people in charge of Robinhood likely know all of this and are doing everything they can to find cash and liquidity to put up the collateral needed to resume GME trading. So far we’ve seen them raise $1B from investors and $500M through lines of credit overnight, although based on the fact that GME is still restricted, that doesn’t seem to be enough. However, in my personal opinion, I think it's likely that Robinhood is doing everything they can to find more money given the situation, and once they do, **they will likely re-enable trading on GME. If that happens (which IMO will probably be some time next week), GME and all other high-SI stocks will absolutely** 🚀🌝\*\*.\*\*

## How GME Almost Caused (and Still Can Cause) a Stock Market Crash

Let’s go over something else interesting that went on as a result of the GME short squeeze - the fact that it started to affect the stock market overall. In fact, the stock market had the largest decline since October across all sectors on Wednesday when GME, AMC, and other high-SI stocks surged, with a very sharp recovery as the meme stocks fell after Robinhood suspending purchases; this was one of the biggest de-grossing of hedge funds in history. [Chamath wrote a great Twitter thread about this](https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1354883147523997697), so amazing that I’ll just copy-paste his tweets rather than try to explain it better myself.

&gt;*A children's book explanation of what's happening:*  
&gt;  
&gt;*1. If you are ""smart money"" you are allowed to take your $1 and leverage it up to $15+*  
&gt;  
&gt;*2. You can now buy $15 of stock AND if you promise to short companies, you can short $15 of stock as well*  
&gt;  
&gt;*3. In finance language, this means that you are $30 ""gross"" ($15 of longs + $15 of shorts) but $0 net (+$15 of longs -$15 of shorts). This makes everyone feel good because it feels like you are taking zero risk...but in reality, your $1 is exposed to $30 of risk.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*4. Now you go around and tell your friends about both your longs and your shorts and when you do it at a restaurant vs on Reddit, its called an ""ideas dinner"".*  
&gt;  
&gt;*5. You also publish your longs on a quarterly lag via an SEC rule.  You don't have to tell anyone about your shorts.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*6. Now the less cool people who weren't invited to the ideas dinners, start copying your longs based on your report.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*7. You realize that publicizing your shorts is also a good idea so instead of only selling stocks, you also BUY options (puts) which has to be reported.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*8. Now everyone can see both your longs and your shorts and if you have a hot hand, you can likely predict that the cool people from the dinner as well as the less cool people monitoring your filings will copy you.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*9. But then an outsider notices that the math is way off!*  
&gt;  
&gt;*10. Apparently, some of these shorts that you own represent more than 100% of the entire stock of the company. Huh?*  
&gt;  
&gt;*11. So he grabs his chicken fingers and champagne and buys, starts a massive short squeeze. 12. Other's see what's happening and they jump in.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*13. Now a massive short squeeze starts.  You have to cover your shorts ASAP. But the banks also notice that you don't have enough credit to cover the $30 they lent you and ask for more collateral. You now also have to sell your long positions.*  
&gt;  
&gt;*14. What happens next is that a cascade of short covering and long selling starts driving some stocks to the moon and others way down.  Which stocks went up? Basically the ones that were the most heavily shorted by you and your buddies in the first place.*

[Hedge fund grossing \/ de-grossing](https://preview.redd.it/c5we1d7e0se61.png?width=761&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7a11131168d69e5f3aea93c8fd087a1478500ddc)

In other words, as stocks like GME go up, the highly-leveraged hedge funds that are shorting these stocks are forced to sell their longs as they cover their shorts. Most retail investors are limited to 2x leverage, but since hedge funds are “hedged” by taking short and long positions, they can be up to 30x levered since theoretically they would be shielded from external events that cause all stocks to go up or down in price (i.e. Beta neutral), so they’re “safer”. To get out of these short positions, they will need to massively unwind their long positions as well so they can still have a reasonable “Net Exposure”, triggering a sell-off in those stocks.

A very similar thing actually happened in March (with risk-parity) causing hedge funds to similarly massively de-gross, and literally everything from GLD to even AMZN’s stock price dropping as a result, even though theoretically COVID-19 would’ve been good for both from a fundamental basis, as we saw later on. It’s very likely that if Robinhood hadn’t stopped purchases of GME, many more hedge funds shorts would have had their shorts blow up and be forced to continue to de-gross causing a widespread stock market crash, potentially being the catalyst for finally popping the [decade-long liquidity (leverage)-fueled asset bubble we’ve been experiencing.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ghcfn5/dddd_the_20102020_liquidityfueled_asset_bubble/) In fact, this could still happen since it doesn’t look like hedge funds have learned their lesson and **are still heavily short GME with Net Shares Shorts barely moving this week** [**according to S3 Partners**](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1355225495835709441)**.** Furthermore, despite seeing the largest de-grossing of hedge funds since 2009, **gross exposure (aka leverage) of hedge funds still remains** [**close to record-high levels**](https://www.reuters.com/article/retail-trading-hedgefunds/goldman-sees-hedge-fund-exposures-close-to-records-ongoing-sell-off-risk-after-gamestop-swings-idUSL1N2K60GW).

**TLDR**

In case your attention span was too short to read everything above,

1. Robinhood is going to be doing everything they can to raise cash to resume GME purchases, when this happen GME 🚀🌝
2. Much of the stock market’s value is held by over-leveraged hedge funds, so **if GME (and other common shorts) 🚀🌝 the rest of the stock market might collapse around it (EDIT - as hedge funds re-consider their long / short strategy), triggering a financial crisis**

*Now, just to be clear, buying GME right now is joining a game of hot potato; the longer you hold the potato the more tendies you get to eat for dinner, but at some point this will all blow up and when it does someone will be the bagholder - and right now everyone is rooting for these bagholders to be the hedge funds that are short GME. That being said, with Short Interest barely moving this week, this day of reckoning doesn’t look like it’ll be coming in the next few days and for reasons mentioned above, it’s probably more likely for GME to reach $1K next week than the probability that it’ll fall below $100.*

Or in other words, [I like these stocks](https://www.highshortinterest.com/).

EDIT - Appearently S3 Partners just contradicted [their tweet on Friday](https://s3partners.com/Exclusive.html?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=announcement&amp;utm_campaign=10ds) and now indicate that shares short of GME have dipped below 30M shares. Still highly shorted compared to most other stocks, fwiw.

EDIT2 - Getting alot of questions on how one short position in a small cap can do this, and my answer is that GME alone wouldn't cause a financial crisis, but rather what GME represents, which is disproving that hedge funds that a long / short strategy (i.e. taking out additional leverage to short similar companies they long) is unviable; The word from my hedge fund friends is that this type of thing would have been considered a six-sigma event, or one in a billion chance of happening; which is obviously no longer true. Hedge funds seeing Melvin go down will probably start re-consider their short books. This on mass will cause a mass short-covering and also sell-off of their longs. Hedge funds levering up using cheap money has been the basis of the stock market's rise the past year - how do you think money magically goes from Powell's money printer to the stock market?";wallstreetbets

**ADM and Future for Sustainable Agriculture and Cost Reduction**

Ok, supposedly everyone cares about sustainable business models and the environment nowadays. Which they should. But sometimes it is a little more complicated than just buying an electric vehicle. Food production is a massive contributor to global CO2 emissions. See: [https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507104446.htm) (TLDR: Soybean trade is bad for the environment.)

Soybean and Corn is currently processed for animal feed. But guess what, you can create animal feed with minimal land, space and water. How? The answer is insect protein.

&amp;#x200B;

Insect Protein Animal Feed Industry

Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and InnovaFeed plan to begin building what will be the world’s largest insect protein facility in 2021 in the city of Decatur in central Illinois.

PROS:

\- Black soldier fly larvae eat non-compostable food waste bound for landfills + produce hundreds of times more protein per acre than traditional animal feed sources. This will be attractive to the public with the growing consciousness of environmental sustainability.

\- Current animal feed is sourced from soybean meal and corn meal. The massive quantities of corn and soybean farming requires large amounts of land and water. Insects can be grown indoors, requiring far less land and water.

\- **Not only does the farming of insects decrease CO2 emissions in itself, these insects eat and feed on WASTE. This food processing decreases CO2 emissions AND reduces landfill waste.**

CONS:

\- Insect food processing is still not cost competitive with traditional animal feed; however, innovation and sustainability always comes with a cost.

# TLDR

\- ADM is currently holding 10% less market cap while trading at a lower P/E and P/S. (Compared to CTVA, it's biggest competitor.)

\- ADM provides 2x the annual dividend (Compared to CTVA, its biggest competitor.) AKA BOOMERS LIKE DIS STOCK TOO.

\- ADM shows consistent (although slow) year over year growth. Current financials do not project ADM to be a growth stock. I believe this what causes it to trade at such a low price to earnings ratio (50% lower than market average); however, I believe their initiative for a more sustainable business model will change this in the long term.

\- Insect farming reduces required land and water. You can literally raise these in a small indoor facility anywhere in the world...or even the moon 🚀 🚀 . Insect farming has potential to be much cheaper than current business models. Insect farming reduces CO2 emissions and they feed for landfill waste. You can grow feed for livestock while reducing the amount of landfill waste AND reducing CO2 emissions.

Positions: I am only holding shares at the moment. As we are seeing a current market pull back, I will most likely enter LEAPS 1/20/2023 $55C. This allows time for the insect protein segment to develop. Who knows, maybe they can even get government tax incentives for this sustainable initiative. 🚀 🚀

Sorry this isn’t GME. Remember you can hold more than 1 stock at once, unless you’re poor.";wallstreetbets
RlCKJAMESBlTCH;1612141309;l9qvf9;588;Unpopular $GME DD;"Before I start, let me just say that I am all about the $GME train and hope it is a 1-way trip to Uranus for all those holding with diamond hands. I have been around WSB for years under this username and my other, less anonymous one. Check my other posts to confirm I am not hedgie agent scum.

Now, to the unpopular part: a word of caution. I see a lot of DD around here analyzing the short interest, the $GME public float, and theories about what that means for the trading price of the stock. Yes, we like the stock. HOWEVER, all of this DD fails to consider one very important variable – the authorized but unissued shares of $GME.

If you look at $GME’s articles of incorporation (this is the document that gives a company its corporate existence and, among other things, states the number of shares the company is authorized to issue), you will see that $GME is authorized to issue up to 300,000,000 shares. Currently it looks like there are about 70,000,000 shares outstanding depending on whose number you go with. So, theoretically, the board of directors of $GME could issue three times the number of shares that are currently outstanding today.

Is the board going to do that? Your guess is as good as mine. On one hand, the board is certainly not going to go out of their way to help out a bunch of hedge funds that were trying to total screw them over and drive them into the ground. But on the other hand, the board has a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of the shareholders of the company. If they can raise a bunch of money selling stock at a $300+ price level, they have to legally consider it. This could significantly improve their balance sheet by allowing them to take out debt with the cash proceeds from a very rich equity sale.

So, could they easily issue more shares? The answer is yes. In December, the company filed an automatic shelf registration statement. This allows them to, essentially at any time and very quickly register a follow-on public equity sale. You can bet your ass that these shorts have been making calls into the company to see what the appetite would be in taking this route, which could allow them to get out of their positions for substantially less than would be the case if they had to cover in the secondary market (because, diamond hands, of course).

Now a couple of good things, even if the board wanted to do this, it seems very risky for all concerned. I think we all know that after the squeeze is done, hitting whatever price it is going to hit ($1,000, $10,000, $42,069???), eventually the price is going to come back to land (could be a week, a month, a year, who knows). When that happens, selling stock at a hugely inflated value based on earning performance (note that I have argued the price today of $GME is totally supported for economic reasons) is going to invite lawsuits galore, so perhaps the board (Which is risk averse by nature) doesn’t want to make a move without letting things settle out. Time will tell. Also, all of this free press has to be a boon for business and I have to believe that the board sees what happened with Robinhood (aka Robbin’ Gainz) where they totally disenfranchised their whole user base in a single day and saw the valuable lesson there. Thus, this is another reason that the $GME board probably won’t issue more shares to screw over the WSB investors, many of whom are their target market.

All that said, I want to see the $GME rocket broaching interstellar space like the rest of you MONKEs.🦍🍌🚀🌖🌖🌖🌖

Also, need to give some love to the rest of the $BANG stocks, $BB, $AMC, and $NOK. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Let’s hope the $GME board also has diamond hands and lets this ship fly!!!!!
💎👋🚀🌖

Edit 1: Tl;dr I predict 💎👋🦍🍌🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖, but there is a risk that the company refuels our ship prematurely.

Edit 2: I will qualify my comments by acknowledging the fact that the NYSE does have a “20% Rule” which generally requires shareholder approval for a NYSE-listed company from issuing more than 20% of its outstanding, so that is a real constrain as well. There are some exceptions to this, but no one wants to read more about this.";wallstreetbets
UmmDuhhh;1612137263;l9pjfm;411;Life AFTER GME - Back to doing some DD!;"Good evening OG and newbie autists,

**TLDR = HOLD GME for as long as you can this DD is for AFTER the squeeze, once out get your money into PUTS.**

I wanted to bring you some DD that I have been working on but first let me get something out of the way.  I am tired of all the stock talk and we need to get back to some old school DD so we know where to YOLO our GME returns AND talk about options again.  I do not recommend getting out GME for any reason for the below.  This is what I think is occurring now and over the next few months, or faster, pending the severity of the situation.  If the situation is as severe as u/johnnydaggers &amp; u/vinlo make it look then this could happen A LOT faster.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The unfortunate part is I am a bull by nature, always have been.  This write-up is extremely bearish in nature but before calling me a 🏳️‍🌈🐻it is only because of the unique situation us glorious folk has put us in with uncovering a massive issue with the market.

What is going on now is starting to look a lot like 2008/09.  I believe that the HF's got caught so bad with their naked short selling that there is literally no way to unwind the damage that they are doing.  For some reference PLEASE read this post as I believe this is the catalyst to what I am posting below.  I was missing a piece but tonight I believe I found it:

[u/johnnydaggers &amp; u/vinlo naked short selling write up](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9jbc5/listen_to_me_we_cannot_trust_the_short_interest/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3)

I started looking at the 08/09 housing crash and then it hit me that the VW squeeze was also occurring around this time.  So what I wanted to see was how much liquidity came out of the market between the squeeze and the housing crisis.  **Can you believe the VW squeeze dropped the market more than the housing crisis?**  The below SPY chart goes from 7/1/2008 to somewhere mid-April.

* You can see that just after the squeeze started the entire market started to dump.  This most likely had to with liquidity and all the same issues we are seeing now
* The VW squeeze dropped the SPY 37% in about 6 weeks
* There was then a 26% rebound during the **peak** of the short squeeze - This tells me the people that were screwed in this one were consolidating liquidity and once they had an idea of what was going on moved into buying calls prior to shorting the market and exacerbating the housing collapse.
* The entire market was still trending down after this rebound until the lowest of lows of the housing market crash

Here is what piqued my interest.  The VW squeeze dropped the SPY **37%** from beginning to end, and the entire housing crisis dropped SPY **28%**?  **HOW IS THIS EVEN REMOTELY POSSIBLE?**

[I eat chalk, not crayons, they taste better.](https://preview.redd.it/4gzqdeml6re61.png?width=1478&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=cf799e7b86ec26b0b6afcefdf241cb1b48131306)

So I take this info and now look at the current SPY chart and see what GME is doing to the overall market.  This is where we are now:

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ppqn65f48re61.png?width=706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=a3db07d8189af90cc0d6c56cdc5c373820d5f9ea

If we apply some basic math the correct on the market could be somewhere in the 240s.  Yes, I know how crazy that sounds but I believe this to be the beginning of the bubble popping.  We exposed a HUGE crack in the foundation and I think it is only going to get worse especially if any of the additional data provided above is accurate.  If it is then we could be looking at a correction closer to the 45% overall range in the next 6-9 months.

This report will discuss the current and future state of Blackberry Ltd (“**Blackberry**”) and its business viability. Too long has the cycle of research been held in the hands of big banks that are incentivized to publish aggressive price targets at the point of a transaction. Too long have buy-side institutions been caged inside an investment parameter that is geared towards accumulating capital than growing it.

We will be discussing Blackberry’s product suite and its defensibility in their respective ecosystems, what value Blackberry brings to the world and various valuation metrics to justify a price target of over CAD$100.

The Blackberry product suite is largely deployed in hi-tech environments with sophisticated buyers seeking the highest security uncompromising in the sight of an indelicate user interface. This includes both its cybersecurity and QNX platforms.

QNX is vital to the self-driving ecosystem and will be the de-facto operating system at the point of multiple catalysts. This includes the first approved autopilot system in any jurisdiction, the first cybersecurity attack on a connected vehicle non QNX related and diamond handed people in WSB.

[SPX current comparison](https://preview.redd.it/jexd28xazre61.png?width=1169&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ac7b64688498b98ec83c2f57aae10b620d29c7b0)

The above chart shows the current 5 year SPX chart compared to an example of a past three peaks and a dome house pattern. Based on this March was not a crash but a signal of what's to come. As you can see if i am correct this will be the only time in history this pattern has occurred over a timeframe this large. I am not screaming the sky is falling, but facts point to the very likely possibility. 6/10 of the largest market rallies were during the great depression and 2/10 were during the 08 crisis. this is no different.

Timing

The above is the current spy chart over a 5 year period. I am operating under the theory that in april we entered the deflationary spiral seen in depressions, through fed intervention, stimmys, and other market factors we have yet to see the full brunt. My prediction is that the market will rally a bit over the next 2-3 weeks, and then begin its descent with the large drop coming in 4-6 weeks. This can be affected by an infinite amount of factors which could accelerate or prolong the pattern. According to pattern, we will see new ATH or near it on SPX then we will go down.

Now, why should this scare you? Imagine a financial system full of Chads. These Chads got greedy, just like they did before, and let's be real, Chad's don't learn their lessons. These same Chads didn't just short one stonk, i.e GameStop, these factory reject dildos shorted pretty much everything. Refer to the list of stocks with short percents above 60%. That's why it's not just GME that's being squeezed, it's BB, it's NOK, it's FIZZ, it's MAC, it's every single highly shorted stock because these Chads just realized that they have to cover their pasty asses from being completely obliterated.

The thing about these Chads though is they convinced Brett, Cody, Kevin &amp; Pauly, the yacht owning, sperry and plaid short wearing dude bros that their shorts were smart. So what did these upside down Greek Symbols do? They bet on the outcome of the Chads being right.

tldr: Want to keep your tendies? Then read this post.

First   of all, $10k isn't a meme 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 BUY AND HOLD  💎🤲 💎🤲   💎🤲. Also, fuck Robincrooks. Go to a real broker to buy shares like  Fidelity, TD, etc.

Since the short squeeze maybe around the corner I am just posting as a reminder to all the fellow soldiers in this war against the shorts.

Now...Many of us are making money we haven't seen in our lives, and some of us haven't invested at all.

This euphoria may make people forget the that...***Uncle Sam wants his cut.💵🇺🇸***

I know this gets mentioned in the comments but we can forget when we see the share price rocket, so this needs to be reiterated over and over. Also, I don't want anyone to get fucked next April because they forgot about some boring shit like taxes and income brackets. ***The IRS DOES NOT fuck around. The IRS is basically Liam Neeson in Taken -- ""If you let my daughter go now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue  you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will kill you.”***  They will find you and take what is theirs.

Remember, your gains will cover your taxes so set aside money for it when you cash out.

**How much you need to set aside depends on the state you live in and how much you make/made. So, please find out how much you need to set aside BEFORE you starting using the tendies!**  
If you live in a no income tax state like Texas or Washington, then great you get to keep more money, but you still have to pay federal income tax.

***Please don't be a retard and invest it back in because you can lose it.*** *Put it in a savings account, let it sit as cash in your brokerage account, or withdraw it and stuff it under your mattress (the worst idea but to   each their own)*

If you want to invest, then invest your other profits minus the tax money.

***If you are a dependent, then please talk to your parents/guardians.*** (***Realistically this mostly pertains to college students because anyone under 18 years can't open a brokerage on their own. But if your parents/guardians don't  know and you are under 18, then please talk to them.)***

**Most important for moving up in income brackets (PLEASE FUCKING READ IT):Some people will be jumping income tax brackets, and will be out of the low-income thresholds.**   If this you think this will be you and you are currently getting low-income benefits like medi-cal, food stamps, etc. Please set aside money to pay for healthcare if you aren't getting any from your work.

Okay boring tax reminder set aside...***This next part is for the college students that are going to make bank, because I know there are a few.***

Some of you autists are college students and are getting FAFSA or some need-based financial aid. ***Make sure you aren't going to fuck yourself out of financial aid*** because some of you WILL be fucking yourself out of financial aid and I hope you have a plan for it by working or applying for scholarships.

Colleges will be the ones eating your tendies; if you lose financial aid and don't have a plan.

Why I say some is because FAFSA only looks at prior taxes so next year's FAFSA will ask for 2020 taxes but tendies are coming in 2021 so you have one year of financial aid before FAFSA asks for 2021 taxes which is going to fuck you hard.Technically if you are graduating in 2023 you will be fine, I think, because the 2022-2023 FAFSA application will open in Oct 2021 so it will ask for 2020 taxes.(There are other questions about how much money have invested, in checking/saving accounts, and what not, but FAFSA really cares about your adjusted gross income which will be high because we are leaving this fucking solar system 🚀🚀🚀)

2023-2024 FAFSA application will ask for 2021 taxes, so if you think you are going to be applying for financial aid for those years, then please have a plan ready.

**Again, please make sure you find out everything IMMEDIATELY AFTER cashing in for the tendies!!**

I am not a financial advisor, or CPA. \*insert whatever legal disclaimer here\*

I am posting this as a reminder so my fellow 💎🤲 so don't get fucked over.

They are in full panic mode and their only shot of having control is to shift blame from them to you. 

The Federal Reserve Cartel has been printing dollars into oblivion. The average normie does not understand the everything bubble we are in and they do not understand dollar inflation. Thus far I've had to explain what a ""short"" is to about 5 people who know nothing of whats going on other than what the talking heads on the TV screen are telling them. Because of this it will be very easy for the MSM to convince niave Boomers and others ignorant of the markets and financial terminology that it was ""memes and shit posting"" by all of us ""unsophisticated investors"" who are to blame for the economic black swan event unfolding. Their ""Problem, reaction, solution"" is to make it seem like YOU are the cause of the economic and financial collapse by simply turning their own game on them. The reaction will be the demand for help coming from the normies and mid-wits who are niave and ignorant as to why shit hit the fan. The solution will be ""New regulations to make sure this will NEVER happen again!"" And thats where they think they will fuck you... Only this time they won't. You must not allow this to become what happened after 9/11 where the problem and solution led to them fucking us over with bullshit unconstitutional laws. 

We all know who the real criminals are.

We all know their game. 

Make no mistake, all the talking TV heads have their scripts ready and all the politicians and regulators have their ""new"" laws ready to be signed. They will make sure that only the ""sophisticated investors"" can invest while they add taxes and regs that will squeeze the little guy out of the markets. 

You think AOC supports what happened to Melvin because she's so adept at economics and financial matters? She has an agenda with her band of retards to slip in taxes that will fuck you.

TheM0L3;1612144119;l9rril;219;Why Robinhood is not the enemy;"Robinhood was a great idea for Citadel.  Make a sexy and “gamified” stock trading interface and market it to the masses, then use the data to make better trades.  

But somehow I think this beast has gotten away from them.  Suddenly the masses are more interested than ever in the stock market.  They are sharing their ideas and experiences in an open forum and finding out that they are actually in agreement on what stocks to buy.

Here is the problem; hedge funds pay billions of dollars for our data to companies like Robinhood, Facebook, and Mastercard.  They spend billions more on algorithms and the fastest systems just to make trades on companies that WE ARE SUPPORTING.  What value is any of that if you already bought a share of MCD on Robinhood before you even paid for your cheeseburger?  We can suddenly beat them at their own game.

I think the next logical step in this progression is that Robinhood goes down hard, Robinhood users get settlement cuts of a few hundred dollars, and we feel like we really stuck it to the man, but did we?

Robinhood is the best weapon we have right now to arm the lower class with the same weapons as these hedge funds, and they are more than happy to nuke it before we realize.  Sure most out there will move over to other brokers but let’s face it, other brokers like TD and Fidelity are intimidating to begin trading on, and won’t encourage the everyday masses to learn more about money.

So feel free to take your money elsewhere and by all means make Vlad and those rich assholes at the top of Robinhood pay.  But ask yourself why Ted Cruz agrees with AOC on going after Robinhood, because he sure as hell doesn’t care about retail traders.

The very value of everything is being rocked to its core right now.  Hell a currency with a literal endless supply shot up 1000%.  If everyone in our society can make a living swiping their phones all day, maybe Wal-Mart has to pay their employees a bit more or improve their working conditions.

The boomers go wild, coughing and scratching their eczema in excitement.

They know what you want.  They know you'll pay anything for it.  You drove the price of $BB up to $30 in a banana-hungry rage, and as soon as you let off the gas the price has returned back to $14.  This tells you everything:  The stock isn't heavily shorted, this wasn't a squeeze, they were just answering high demand by manipulating you into over-paying.

You have to be patient: fuel the ship, calibrate the boosters, load the cargo and only then can you prepare for your trip to mars.  Give $BB time to build the biodome so you can land safely.

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails–to–deliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options – both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

classicmint1934;1612142707;l9rbcn;144;My GameStop winning strategy...;"I am not a financial analyst or business analyst in any way. In no way should this be taken as advice by anyone or acted on in any way. I am, however, a stock-trading gamer who is currently sipping Pinot while writing this up for your wife's boyfriend to read on the toilet later tonight, all because of the $GME gains.  


Haha gotcha. HOLD! Sorry, Musk, but once my shares head into space the only thing you are gonna be able to brag about is that you land spent rockets on sea platforms.  


GameStop is still a viable company. Make me CEO (or at the very least a VP of some sort) because my Pinot-drinking ass has some baller ass ideas.  


(1) GameStop needs to start an active campaign with gamers protesting our inability to physically own property that we purchased. When I bought *Legend of Zelda* in its sweet metallic cartridge, I was able to sensuously rub my fingertips along the gold cartridge, savoring the pattern of oily smudges my callused hands left. I was able to trade it or sell it to someone, not to mention smell it. There was value in the game beyond just playing it. I could even sell it to GameStop for a whole dollar if I so chose. 

GameStop needs to be louder about this.  


Pokémon card collecting is still going strong. Folks are chasing physical cards, but what they are not doing is jumping to use the online codes shoved into each pack. Those are meaningless compared to the cards themselves. There is still a lot of demand for physical property, and this can be observed by thousands of gamers who wait in line for physical disk releases, many of whom are paying extra for ‘deluxe’ versions of their game.  


(1a) GameStop can use this buzz to make agreements with Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo (and others of course) to allow them to sell ‘ownable’ versions of digital games. Yes, digital is nice and convenient, but do I own my copy? Can I trade it or sell it for a different game? Allow us to do this with digital copies and GIVE THE POWER BACK TO THE PLAYERS. GameStop can step in and buy back and resell digital keys on their website.  


(2) GameStop needs to become involved in sponsorship of competitive gaming. HEAVILY! They should have a goal to become the go-to name in that rising sport. Why can’t they host competitions with buy-ins and payouts similar to professional poker tournaments? Why think of the GameStop brand as a simple brick-and-mortar retailer? Amazon sold books, for shit’s sake, now they are selling everything cheap East-Asian labor can produce while at the same time hosting web services. The sky's the limit.  


That's all I've got for now. I see three possible outcomes to this post: downvoted or disappeared into the dark void of Reddit new (most likely); a series of shit posts about my wine (what are you degenerates drinking? Don't talk to me about your whiskey dicks); or, my personal preference, a running list of ‘$GME go burrr’ and ‘HOLD’ responses. To the moon, babies.

zachjvd;1612142524;l9r9at;6;This is the conclusion of an SEC report on counterfeiting shares, dated September 17th, 2008;"""Certain market participants, trading illegally, appear to be making a concerted effort to take down some of the most important financial institutions in the United States. Who would counterfeit shares of these vital U.S. institutions to cause their financial collapse without regard for the U.S. citizens? It is not possible to carry out this massive fraud without the cooperation of large Wall Street firms and regulatory complicity, indifference or lack of competence. Some firms are blatantly selling shares that do not exist.  25 It is impossible to ward off the downward price pressure from counterfeit shares diluting a company‘s value. The entire nation‘s value is diminished when the counterfeiting of securities is rampant. Simply put, this is a defining moment in the history of the financial strength of the United States. Other than home ownership assets, the largest U.S. household assets are tied to the stock market through retirement accounts. If counterfeiting continues, investment and retirement accounts will be backed by nothing but counterfeit shares, which they may already be holding in substantial amounts. To conceal the fraud perpetrated on the retirement accounts is simple, manipulate the markets to crash. The money previously plundered from these accounts remain in the hands of the counterfeiters and the statements sent by the Wall Street firms to retirement investors will reflect a crashed market value of their assets, i.e., you lost your retirement savings. The counterfeiting of U.S. traded securities is nothing less than a fraud of epic proportions. As with other illegal stock market activity, offshore shell companies are a likely depository of the ill-gotten gains. While U.S. citizens would like to trust that government regulators are putting the citizens first and protecting investors, this may not be the case. The ownership and trading irregularities in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac discussed above, seem so obvious, that surely our government would have taken the steps necessary to protect investors in these very important financial institutions from fraud in the market. Unfortunately, the facts do not support that the government did enforce the securities laws against fraud and market manipulation. It is necessary for the United States to do everything within its power to recover the enormous amount of monies that have been plundered from this country and its citizens. Bring the few illegal dealers responsible for counterfeiting stock to justice in order to assure that this United States economic disaster will never repeat itself. There is simply too much at stake to do otherwise.""

featherfactor;1612142050;l9r422;293;Americans: taxes on tendies;"Have been seeing a lot of posts on taxes without details on what/where you owe (and confused apes in the comments). Here are the basics (not a professional cpa; just someone offering some basic advice):

If you are trading in a tax-exempt account (IRA, Roth IRA, 401k, etc): congratulations, you don’t have to worry about taxes on your tendies (at least for now)

If you are trading in a standard brokerage account, keep reading:

1) if you bought and sold a stock for a profit within 365 days,* the profit is considered short term capital gains. However, all cap gains/losses are considered together (write off losses against gains). 

Example: you bought $10k GME Jan 1. Sold GME in April (diamond hands) for $1,000,000. That is $990k profit. Now if you decided you’ve had enough for the year and ride off into the sunset, you owe taxes on the $990k. The tax rate will depend on other income you have. It is taxed as regular income tax. Look up your marginal tax rates for state and federal income tax for your situation (ie married filing jointly would pay lower taxes vs single). Rule of thumb: set aside 40% (usually will be more than enough). 

Example 2: However let’s say you are regarded and try to gamble it all on options in July 2021. Sadly, your $990k is a total loss. Congrats. You have no net gains/losses. You owe no additional taxes. 

Example 3: you are even more regarded and gamble your original investment of $10k hoping to make it back. You lose that too. Now that counts as a net loss for the year of -$10k. Well that sucks. But at least you can deduct $3k of it from your regular income (and carry the other $7k over to be deducted in future years). Note, this does not mean you get $3k back. It means if your income is $50k, you now get to deduct $3k and pay income tax on $47k. 

2) now, if you bought GME Jan 1 and missed the squoze and finally decide to sell in February 2022 for a reasonable gain of $2,000, you have now achieved one of the rich ppl cheat codes for taxes.  That $2k will be taxed at the long-term cap gains rate for tax year 2022. For 2020 tax year, those tax brackets (single filers) are 0% if your total income is less than $40k, 15% for income between 40 and 440k, and 20% if over that). Note there may also be a state cap gains tax as someone mentioned CA’s is 13-14% (please confirm for your state). If you have other losses, you can write those off against the gains same as before. 

Also tip: all of this is SUPER easy to do in TurboTax. TurboTax automatically links to most big name brokerage accounts and all the calculations of what sold when for how much at what cost basis is done automatically. It’s super easy to use even you apes can use it. If you have a simple tax situation (eg just your tendies and your regular 9-5), just go with TurboTax. They also have a pro version where you can speak to a cpa if you need help. 




*365 days for short term depends on holding period for asset but yes basically this + 1 day for stocks (ie buy Jan 1, 2021.. sell before Jan 2, 2022, it is short term)

##NOW THAT I HAVE YOUR ATTENTION

I am not well versed in stocks, but I am very experienced with high stress situations. This is particularly  true with planned out high stress scenarios where after running through a plan a million times, I have to live with the idea in my head for hours or days prior to execution. **The only way I stay sane, is I make a plan I can live with, get to know it inside and out, and forget about it.**

&amp;#x200B;

The advanced knowledge of an unpredictable, uncontrollable, and dangerous situation ahead can do a motherfucking number on anyone's cognition. What is most important is to not allow fear or emotion change the way a problem is approached. There is a ***reason*** why the plan was made prior, in the calm. Remember, we are dumb-ass 🦍🦍 figuratively and quite literally.

&amp;#x200B;

**Everything you do should be done with calm intent.** That means, if you planned to hold no matter what, **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If you plan to buy more, set your limits below market to help attack the short ladders when they come and **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If you plan to ~~sell~~ buy, set your limits and **DO NOT WATCH THE FUCKING TICKERS OR THE NEWS.** If the mechanisms of execution have already been decided, why waste precious head space doubting the plan? Go have a 🍌🍌 if tempted to peek.

&amp;#x200B;

The moment a plan is changed based on emotion without vetted, new information is a mistake 99.9999% of the time. In this case, having an open mind during the trading day is a bad idea. The time for open-mindedness was the day prior, while peacefully eating oatmeal or Teddy Grahams. Allowing a plan to be adjusted without reason is terrible in life and in STONKS.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem solving works by changing one variable and observing the results. If a plan is changed several times during the course of execution it will be hard to discern where mistakes were made. This makes improvement very hard, and sometimes impossible.

&amp;#x200B;

###TL;DR **Make your own plan, ask yourself if you can accept the positive or negative outcome, and FUCKING STICK TO IT.** No matter the outcome, you will be more peaceful internally and more able to make better choices next time. Calm 🦍 &gt; Panicked 🦍

vegaseller;1612141461;l9qx8p;541;Why WSB is now running the entire equity market pt.2 - Investment Professional here;"[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why\_wsb\_is\_now\_running\_the\_entire\_equity\_market/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k0ctkd/why_wsb_is_now_running_the_entire_equity_market/)

I wrote an article 2 months ago about why WSB was running the equity markets. I explained how the rise of passive investing (ala Mike Green's thesis) was making it so that the marginal mover of capital was entirely passive, and this is leading to a war between retail (WSB) and hedge funds for the valuation of markets and basically the winner gets to lead the sheep (the passive money). It explains the massive run-up of Tesla/Nio and the endless bids from the likes of vanguard funds once they reach certain market cap hurdles. I won't go into this in depth. Those who wish to find out more should read my previous post and go look up Mike Green from Logica. 

I won't go into details on the gamma convexity squeeze dynamics, and how it is enhancing a lot of momentum and creating feedback loops, for those who want to read more, I would recommend Chris Cole of Artemis capital to talked about this dynamic in the podcast **End Game** with Grant William.

This time around, I will talk about two misconceptions of the market surrounding GME. I will talk about why attacking hedge funds like they are part of the establishment is also pretty misguided. And I will will go over my thoughts on what will happen next.  

**GME Misconceptions**

The two misconceptions on GME have to do with manipulation of GME shares by the brokers and that they are having to do this because the short sellers are trapped in an infinite money black hole. The problem with this narrative is that it ignores some fundamental understanding about how buying shares work. The prevention of GME buying really has nothing to do with market manipulation in collusion with Citadel or Melvin or any market makers. The fact is that the market makers are running trillion dollar flow books and couldn't care less, and Robinhood is not a broker for any hedge funds. The real reason is that some of these smaller brokers don't have enough working capital to fund the required collateral by clearing houses (which was raised on them over the past few days), this is why the largest guys like Fidelity didn't have that issues. Which is why many brokers are drawing down their banking lines (such as Robinhood drawing down $1 billion from banks). Once they bring on enough liquidity, they will enable them again, but until then, we still live in a T+2 settlement world in which brokers have working capital needs. The implementation was retarded, but the brokers basically panicked when they saw their working capital deplete rapidly.

The other misconception has to do with WSB finding in infinite money wormhole. Trust me, I was there when a relative value Fund I interned at in 2009 basically went bust when a short selling ban was implemented. I was there when the Italian banks were on the verge of collapse, sitting on my 10x delta puts with a seven figure paper profit as a 26 year old when Draghi announced LTRO and blew my portfolio up. There are a lot of things that would stop the infinitely money machine, especially if you have been around long enough and have seen all the games being played. One such way is that management can simply issues new shares (likely through a privately placement deal with the short seller consortium), and the likelihood goes up the more the price goes up. Another way is that the SEC could step in and put a short term trading halt while forcing the short sellers into a deal with mgt. 

**Misplaced Hatred of Hedge Funds**

If one looks around the financial landscape today, Hedge funds are actually a dying breed. The young put about 80% of their capital to work in passive while the boomers that are exiting have historically placed about 80% of their capital to work in active funds. As a result, since about  2008, active managers such as mutual funds and hedge funds had actually been dying, even though they played almost no role during the 2008 GFC. If anything, many hedge funds identified problems in the system way earlier and most of the people in the big short were successful hedge fund managers. The problem was that the rise in passive and the fed had manipulated price signals so much so that one cannot actually make money arbitraging value (long undervalued, short overvalued) in a world less and less flow cares about value. 

The narrative being promoted by those who do not understand markets is that these evil hedge funds were shorting stocks, bankrupting companies and forcing layoffs. This could not be further from the truth. The value of a share in a secondary market has no impact on the day to day business of a company. A company could trade at 0 value, but if it generates healthy profits and has a strong balance sheet, it will keep going, hiring people and expanding. The truth is that these ""evil"" hedge funds were managing long short books. They were owning things like Facebook, Apple or it could be distressed debt they thought were undervalued, they were hedging their long book with things they think could go bust in the event of an economic downturn/crisis. 

**What Happens Next**

The effects of the GME short squeeze should not be underestimated, not because of the money lost by shorts on its position of somewhere around $20 billion (that's peanuts in financial markets terms). The full ramification is actually on the long side, from hedge funds who no longer feel like they can hedge out their downside by shorting fundamental unsound companies. I would not be surprised if the action in the markets in the past several days is just the beginning of large unwind because hedge funds will have to now reduce their risk position in their longs, the ramification of which will be in the hundreds of billions to trillions. It could very well be that this de-risking by active managers will lead to the start of a larger correction in the broader market. And as we have seen during the March selloff, without active managers who have cash on their books, who are the buyer of last resort, but instead passive flow, who actually tend to go bid-less in a market crash, we could see increasing volatility the likes we have never seen before. 

If the market does crash, congress may blame this on ""reckless speculators"" and ban option trading for those under certain income/networth thresholds. just as hedge funds are being scapegoated for 2008 despite being innocent, retail may be scapegoated for the next crash despite the real driver of volatility being the rise of passive money. The lack of retail participation in options may mean that he gamma squeeze dynamics will end. 

I have taken off most of my long positions and am sitting on cash and reloading VIX calls and some weekly ATM SPX puts.  Congraduations, you autists have beaten hedge funds (who are more like whales being hunted to extinction than fierce sharks) in the first major battle, but have set yourself to lose one of your most important tools (gamma squeeze). I would suggest taking out your gains and buying downside protection, maybe you'll gamma squeeze the market into a 50% correction and turn yourself into a high-net-worth (HNW) so you can bypass any future retail restrictions.";wallstreetbets

jpdoctor;1612140263;l9qj41;508;No, listen to me: It doesn't matter if short interest is above or below 100% of float. There is still a bigass short squeeze.;"Some folks seem confused about the fact that greater than 100% of GME floated shares are short.  (example [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/).) 

I'm here to tell you: IT DOES NOT MATTER whether the short percentage is above or below 100%.  Even 20% of a stock being shorted is a bigass signal that locating enough shares to cover is going to be REALLY HARD.

So let's look at why 100% of shares shorted doesn't matter: Shorted shares work exactly the same as money multiplication in fractional-reserve banking.  Picture a stock with exactly 1 share in its float, and that share is owned by autist ""A"". Shorter B borrows the share via a broker, sells to a buyer C, and the buyer C leaves it with the broker. The broker loans it out again to another shorter D, who sells to another buyer E.

Now there are two people who have shorted (B, D) and the short interest is 200% of the float. Note also: three people think they own the stock, and the total shares they own is 300% of the total shares issued by the company.  

**IT SIMPLY DOES NOT MATTER THAT 100% of the shares are shorted because there are now 200% of the shares in the hands of longs.** 

When you count up the total shares held by longs, even 1 share is loaned out for a short results in more than 100% of the float are owned by longs.

So GME has 113% of the float shorted on Friday, which means 213% is in the hands of longs.  This is still a VERY tough scenario to cover.

You probably never heard of them. You've never seen CEO Mike Bodson on CNBC. They like it that way.

But it was the DTCC that **raised Robinhood's collateral requirements by 10x** [this week](https://blog.robinhood.com/news/2021/1/29/what-happened-this-week), causing them to raise an emergency $1 billion and halt trading on many stocks.

Vlad would LOVE to tell you this on air, but he can't. He is completely under the thumb of the DTCC. It's a case of ""we have altered the deal, pray we don't alter it any further""

Listen, I don't trust Robinhood. They're a bunch of 🤡🤡🤡.  But at least they provide a valuable service, when it's working.

What service does the DTCC provide?

Zilch. Nada. They are **pure middlemen**, earning a toll while providing nothing of value and taking no risk.

The DTCC is a clearinghouse. A clearinghouse ""settles"" the trades made at the brokerage. When you're manically clicking buttons all day on your phone, each time you create a trade. That trade doesn't ""settle"", and the stock doesn't become ""really"" yours until two days later when the DTCC moves it to your account.

Now if that sounds like some horse and buggy shit, that's because it is. The T+2 settlement is a relic of a bygone era when some broker had to rustle up paper stock certificates out of a filing cabinet and have his fuckboi carry them across town.

Now at some point before all of us were born, horse and buggies gave way to the internal combustion engine, and stock exchanges went electronic. The clearinghouses are just a glorified database run by legions of fuckbois carrying papers to and fro. They're obsolete. But they have money, and therefore powerful friends in Wall St. and Washington.

So clearinghouses had their role protected by regulation. **T+2 settlement is the LAW**. And the DTCC remains a powerful chokepoint that can change the rules to manipulate the market.

You were ready for a fight between David (retards) and Goliath (hedge funds). But the real Goliath on the other side is far bigger than we thought, it's the entire might of the US regulatory state and its leeches.

If you have suggestions for how to stick it to the man, I'm all ears.

# tl;dr

We are getting fucked over by the big bois, and they would laugh all the way to the bank to see us take down Robinhood without even noticing their existence.

Firstly you announce today that the shorts are not actually covered contrary to what mainstream media is shoving down everyone’s throat. 

Then you announce that in the space of 6 hours the shorts have covered down to 30 mil on a Sunday with no data mentioned at all after a massive “unexpected delay” 


Stop trying to spead fear it won’t work. You are using the same tactics as the 🏳️‍🌈🍋

You reported yourself that on the 28th there was still 58 million in short interest. If thats correct 30 mil was covered on Friday when the overall volume for the day was 50million lol


Edit 1/ The other thing is due to the fact $gme is such a big deal right now why would you publish premature results that you admit yourself are just “suggesting” the short interest has halved. Wouldn’t you actually want to be confident and wait for all the data to be collected which you say won’t be finalised until tomorrow so the results may be more accurate.

Edit 2/ Thank you for awards but buy $gme instead!

Edit 3/ For paid customers who use the platform the short interest  is still showing 100%. Either the announcement is wrong or the product doesn’t work.

thestateofflow;1612137458;l9plqg;311;Next Short Interest Release date?;"Hey so I was thinking, a lot of people are saying the hedge funds are still in this fight and didn’t actually sell.

I happen to also believe this to be true, based on every indicator it seems they want us to believe the **false narrative** that they pulled out.

Companies have until February 2nd 6pm EST to submit their reports on Short Interest and then from there it will be released publicly after **4pm EST** on **Feb. 9th.**

I think this means they have until **Feb.9th at 4pm** to get this stock as low as possible to exit their positions, because if come the 9th there’s still a high short interest rate on the public record, then I think they know retail traders will all double down.

I believe they’re trying to plant the seed in everyone’s mind that tomorrow (Monday) is the final day of this phenomenon. So they’ll happily contribute to making a squeeze happen (anyones guess how high) but then they’ll afterwards push the narrative that it’s over to try to plummet the stock.

I know some people probably plan on holding indefinitely, but for those that do intend to take a profit, even just a partial profit to cover their investments, consider the information above. In the scenario where the stock stays high until after the Short Interest report comes out, it could potentially cause the biggest squeeze yet.

I am not a financial advisor. Please correct me if anything I’ve said is incorrect and I’ll add it as an edit if you’ve provided sufficient evidence.

I own two GME stocks, because I like the stock and believe in the fundamentals.

Edit:

toutoucnc pointed out they could just **lie about the data.** I still think this upcoming date is important to know but don’t rely on the data that will come out as fact. Anything could be misinformation, and I’m a noob at investing so take everything I’ve stated with a large grain of salt.

Edit 2:

That said I think the essence of my post is still valuable. They could help us achieve a short squeeze that feels like it’s all over, but then they could sell off to try to trigger a falling house of cards. I may just **hold** for enternity and pass the stocks down to my children as **relics of the historical event** that led to a mass awakening.

Anyways, right now we're coming off a year of record gains in certain companies and sectors and it's been easy mode.  With the GME and AMC run ups of recent, it's been easy mode (thus far) even more so.  Don't think this is the norm, because it is very much ***NOT***.

After these plays are over (and one day they will be), there will be others.  You'll have to do your own homework (like DFV did for *years* before anyone knew who he was) on potential stock picks and plays.  Please be cautious of anyone who gives you stock picks and I'd actually research them.  I got into GME last year, but I did my own DD before throwing money at it.  It was a decent value play with a very high upside.  But even I didn't think we'd go this far up.

The recent run up feels a lot like the dotcom run up to me.  Different setup and scenario but similar overwhelming positive euphoria and a big draw of people who seemingly have never traded before.  This ended in some serious tears for a lot of people and years of debt or bankruptcy for some.  Getting caught up in a buying euphoria can be dangerous.  Don't let the yolo paydays here fool you, there's been yolo losses too.

WSB isn't your normal trading sub.  This is a place for high stakes bets.  All the memes and humor aside of instant paydays, Rome wasn't built in a day, and your market account probably won't be either.  If you're looking to build wealth and understand the market, this probably isn't the place.  r/finance r/investing and/or r/stocks might be better options if you're new.   Most of the major brokerages have education series on their websites and/or through their apps as well as other online sites that teach basics for free ([investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com) is a fine one imo).  You have a lot of knowledge at your fingertips if you care to learn and make use of it.   Don't be stupid.

TL;DR: S3 Partners announced some breaking news on $GME for today and didn't deliver. They delayed the report by over an hour and then handing out a 12 year olds school report which has been done during the lunch break.

&amp;#x200B;

Earlier this day they were showing indications that media is giving wrong impressions on how shorted the stock is:

""Amid the chaos of [\#GME](https://twitter.com/hashtag/GME?src=hashtag_click), even the experts are confused about what’s going down. That’s why we need impartial data!!

Then again some time later they have published there report which doesn't fit there quality standards and usual work. It gives a strong feeling that they were stopped in publishing their original work and quickly scrambled some stuff together.

martinshkreli;1612135784;l9p1xu;1096;Shkreli on GME - 1/31;"Gamestonk. Gamestop. GME. My thoughts are on Reddit, under my u/martinshkreli &amp; subreddit r/martinshkreli. Those are authentic and discuss why GME is one of the most unprecedented events in market history. Here, I'm going to discuss the populist attitude that is creeping into this odd situation and add some thoughts on short-selling in general.
  
Let's cover my own unique angle on the concept of a 'short squeeze'. Most would define it as an erratic upward change in price driven by short-covering. I believe short-squeezes defined this way are usually a fictitious idee fixe that aggregates a number of discrete market behaviors and dynamics into a convenient and pithy moniker. The image of python-like buyer constricting some hapless speculator into a higher stock price is evocative but misleading. Many knew me as a short-selling specialist on Wall Street, focused on 'binary events' of biotech stocks. I think I've seen it all: I was once short more than 75% of a company's shares outstanding (I do not recommend this). I bought 75% of a company on the open market, etc.
  
Short-sellers are governed by the same market dynamics as longs. They get nervous when positions go against them and consider exiting. Like longs, they can double down if they wish. The only difference is that, of course, short positions grow when stocks rise. And they can rise infinitely, while long positions fall asymptotically to zero. But both get, theoretically and assuming no fundamental changes have occurred, more attractive as they move against the trader.
  
Short sellers have to pay borrow fees to longs (typically tiny, but sometimes massive). They have to locate stock to short, again usually easy, but sometimes difficult. Both are perilous when those rare adverse times arise. Why? Despite the possibility of a growing cost of renting stock, the ultimate fear of a short-seller is a ""buy-in"". It is nightmarish and has only happened to me once or twice, excluding options-related activity. A buy-in occurs when a broker decides to forcibly exit the short position on behalf of the trader because the broker and trader cannot secure the 'locate' which is supposed to underlie the short sale. The buy-in order is typically violently disruptive: a market order for the whole position near the closing hours of the market! The SEC published a list of stocks at risk of buy-in: the fail to deliver list.
  
My point is that a 'short squeeze' can only practically affect the trader for two reasons. The first is that the trader digs in, doubles down and doesn't exit as his position grows. That's bad trading, and will eventually blow the trader up. But, if the stock is a 'good short', that short will be replaced by more traders with stronger hands/a better entry price/smaller position. What's more is the average investor can't tell if this is happening! The second is the buy-in. I haven't heard GME shorts being bought in, but again, how would you know, other than the grapevine? My point is most of the disruptive, exciting trading here is simply long speculators banging away at the stock.
  
New longs are sometimes attracted to rising prices, speculating they'll increase further: that's called momentum. Those buyers are typically offset by the existing longs who are excited to exit at higher prices. But, if there is a large short position in the stock, a speculator may feel that those covering (buying to get out) short-sellers will provide additional fuel to the momentum. That's sometimes the case, but higher prices should lead to more supply from both long and short sellers. My feeling is the actions of large long holders probably have more influence on the stock price than shorts who dart in and out, and typically in smaller size. Remember that shorts who capitulate are often just replaced by new shorts who are attracted at the new lunar prices.
  
In essence, 'short squeezes' become a self-fulfilling prophecy as new long investors pile in trying to 'squeeze' this sometimes phantom of a short seller, and existing long investors may hold off selling for the same reason. With some Popperian skepticism you will easily see that the same dynamic can exist without the short boogeyman, or with a short boogeyman of any size. Speaking of which, where is Chanos and his slavish groupie, Carson Block? 
  
Speculative momentum can occur for any reason. Let's not forget that the 'trapping shorty' strategy is an awkward idea for a few reasons. Short sellers are often sophisticated market participants who are betting on the decline of a stock. You usually don't want these type of traders sniffing around your favorite longs: I recall writing a 'short report' on a stock to watch it fall 50% that day. If you do a study of stock returns of highly shorted stocks, they are pretty awful. The reason there is 'no arbitrage' is the borrow rate. 
  
But even if you got this poor short to capitulate and squeeze, the amount of buyers who are now holding stock at absurdly high prices put way more energy (and money) into the stock than the short seller's white towel ever could. A sledgehammer killed the fly: now what? Alternatively, are you the host or the parasite?
  
On populism. I don't really think most investors or speculators should go into any investment thinking that there is 'an enemy'. Concentrated (big) investments (bets) give rise to emotional behavior, typically the enemy in trading and investing as it clouds rational thinking. It's a lot better to be Socratic with your 'opponent' and understand what they're thinking. If your position were to be half the size it currently is, would you be as emotionally interested? Try it! You'll lower your risk and feel better.
  
Some of the behavior going on at WSB sounds more jihadist than speculative. The idea that there are some investors who are 'good' and others who are 'bad', or that there is an 'establishment' is BS. Everyone has the same goal: I have a pile of money, I'm trying to make it bigger, fuck your pile--I don't care about it. Anything other goal is contrived, foolish and won't help you win. You can't 'fight the rich' by trying to become one of them. Don't you see the irony? A related thought experiment: what if this trade continued to work really well? And another, and another? Then some WSBers are billionaires. Aren't they the new 'enemy/establishment?'
  
Who do you think hedge fund managers are? They're typically the anti-establishment. Things have changed a bit, but the most successful HFMs are actually the WSBers of the past. These are guys who didn't fit in well at i-banks, often got kicked out for having big mouths or not wearing the right ties, or just wanting to wear jeans at work and not fill out TPS reports. When they started their firms, people like Soros, Icahn, Steinhardt, Robertson, Cohen, Griffin, Loeb (who has posted anonymously on boards), Samberg, even Cramer were fish out of water and had very tiny amounts of capital, often begging for investors.
  
The need for an enemy. To sustain increasingly insane behavior, it isn't uncommon to use a straw man or a scapegoat. Oppressive regimes used this technique in the past, and the media uses it today. Retail investors don't have much power individually. With your $5k RH account, you can't day trade or even qualify for margin. It's pitiful. So, it's understandably quite exciting to finally feel like a 'player' that you read about. To be a part of 'something'. The problem is the media is goading you to be somewhere between a lemming and a life-agnostic but impotent jihadist. Blowing yourself up won't impress anyone, and there is no afterlife here, other than a minimum wage career and mom's sofa. GME and shorting in general is small potatos in the scheme of the Wall St. machine. Don't worry about getting 'even' with the rich. That's jousting at a windmill that will waste your energy.
  
No one here, hopefully, wants to be a lemming. Those willing to 'die on this hill' have to realize something: Wall Street doesn't care about its speculators. The new traders who vanquish the old simply replace them. Nothing changes. When LTCM blew up, or Amaranth, Visium, Galleon, or anyone else, it is 'out with the old and in with the new'. So, perhaps WSB can blow up 1 hedge fund or maybe 5, but so what? Eventually, the tables will turn and it will blow up. The leveraged, fast-money trading markets are a violent place and the only people who care one whit are the brokers charging fees (directly or indirectly). They only care to make sure the sorry carcasses can pay their bills. They know there will always be another speculator lined up, ready to shove his money into the lotto machine. There is no pride here. There is no credit for being a good solider. You either survive or you don't. Your job is to survive and thrive. Becoming a lemming will guarantee failure as per the statistical truism of gambler's ruin (enjoy the proof in measure theory). With enough time, anyone playing a game with &lt;50% success rate (equal payouts), will lose all their money. Get that number above 50%. Add the Kelly Criterion to your trading strategy.
  
You might ask, ""(that's all well and good OR we'll agree to disagree) but, Mr. Shrek, isn't this a good trading strategy? (ganging up on shorted stocks)?"" As long as you're not a lemming/jihadist (willing to walk over the cliff, whether or not you have a ""cause""), and you ignore a somewhat slimy ethical/market manipulation question, I don't see anything wrong with it. There are better ways to make money, since you're asking. Stoking (or worse, participating in) a buying frenzy that is akin to a forced musical chairs game is a little crazy. Once a stock is absurdly valued, you're just hoping the sell-off doesn't happen while you're holding it. If you have enough lemmings or jihadists 'helping you', that's a good thing. They will hold your bag--someone needs to. 
  
Of course, if you've found the ""next"" Microsoft or Apple, no one needs to hold any bags. But, no company can increase its objective (aka fair) value quickly enough for this... phenomenon? situation? absurdity?... to make it reasonable. Those things take years, go slow and steady, and this frenzied buying/""short squeeze"" phenomenon won't let value play a factor. That's why WSB GME longs have shifted theses from ""well, Gamestop was/is cheap"" to ""the gaming cycle"" to ""Ryan Cohen will save us"" to ""...jihad?!""
  
Each member of the herd has its own financial parameters, too. Some may have $500, some $50,000,000 or more. Some may be willing to lose their entire stake (and even more) on an out-of-the-money or levered trade. Some are not. Some were in the latter and somehow end up in the former. Some are in one column at one price and another column at another--some are switched from column to column by force. Today's lemmings/jihadists are tomorrow's sellers. When you're hanging off the mountain, pay attention to the guy holding the rope.
  
Loosely 'coordinated' buying can certainly affect stocks. Heavily shorted stocks and small cap stocks are the kind that require less capital than typical to 'move' a stock. The irony here is when putting on a position, the trader's goal is typically NOT to move the stock with his actions!
  
I still think GME is wildly overvalued, but that doesn't exactly mean I'm 'bearish'. One funny idea here is reflexivity: GME stockholders may become serious GME customers and the company's fundamentals improve that way! Excluding some such miracle, eventually GME stock will trade at &lt;50 again. I still think it will trade at 1,000 or more BEFORE that happens, and that the decline process will take a long, long time (several years). Keep in mind, anything can change. GME can do serial secondaries that destroy its stock. Management's job is to create value for their shareholders--but perhaps they will avoid pissing them off. There's a strange loop! Finally, the stock could be halted by the SEC or completely banned by brokers. Don't overdo it. Watch the borrow rate. Keep your positions at less than 25% of your capital--live to play another day. 
  
Disclosure: I've never traded GME stock and do not intend to.

leodavinci11;1612135690;l9p0tr;99;Why retail investors should quit zero-commission platforms right now;"# What is Robinhood's business model?

The company generates significant income from [payments for order flow](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp), a common although controversial practice in which a broker receives compensation and other benefits for directing orders to different parties for trade execution. Robinhood refers to this revenue as rebates from [market makers](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/marketmaker.asp) and trading venues.﻿ While the payments are negligible for small retail trades, a company that directs billions of dollars in trades to market makers can earn substantial amounts. This means that you are not a customer for Robinhood, **you are the product**. Your trading data, even considering it is full of autistic buys and sells, is valuable to the big players in the financial world.

# The conflict of interests

So considering more than half of Robinhood's revenue comes from these big financial companies, all directly connected to big hedge funds, there's a direct conflict of interest between Robinhood's clients going bankrupt and the users of their platform getting rich. The GME short squeeze made by retards like you definitely made Robinhood suffer pressure from its clients and they decided to pick the big cucks side.

# Will retail traders keep trading on zero commission platforms? 

You can't ignore the fact that people are actually retarded, so they will continue to use Robinhood even tho there's always be a chance that all of this happening again. The price of GME only stopped at $400 because most retail investors were trading on Robinhood, **no company should have such a high impact on retail investors** if we are really seeking to bet against cucks from Wallstreet.

**Now what IS the move in 2021, is cannabis stocks.** You can see my post history for a more in depth post, but here's what you need to know [Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is already planning to combine multiple marijuana bills](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.thestreet.com/.amp/investing/cannabis/cannabis-stocks-watchlist-schumer-sundial-growers-tilray-canopy-growth) and has said marijuana will be a priority of the 117th Congress. 

[Vice President Kushala Harris was the Senate sponsor of the MORE act, which among other things would provide banking reform](https://www.google.com/amp/s/norml.org/blog/2020/08/12/senator-kamala-harris-senate-sponsor-of-the-more-act-chosen-to-be-vp-candidate/amp/) 

So what does all this mean? This means $CGC, $APHA, $CRON, $TLRY and most other cannabis stocks are fueling up for a 🚀🚀🚀🚀 over the next year or two as changes are announced and passed. [Including the entire country of Mexico legalizing marijuana this April](https://www.leafly.com/news/politics/mexico-is-moving-to-legalize-cannabis-in-2021-what-does-that-mean-for-the-us). 

So AFTER THE SQUEEZE HAS SQUOZE, do you wanna make Citadel more money OR do you wanna put your dollars into the change you hope to see over the next couple of years? I know the decision is easy for myself, and it's up to each one of you to make your own decisions. This isn't advice, and the only advice I do have for you is: Blue crayons taste the best.

muirnoire;1612135455;l9oy0u;55;Why DID Robinhood halt trading on Thursday? A hypothesis from a fellow autist...;"Consider the following timeline….

Once upon a time, hedge funds and brokerages decided GME was a dog and is the easiest money they’ve ever made and place positions (puts) betting that the price will go down. They placed bets to the tune of 140% of nominal value of all shares outstanding.

Some autists on Reddit identify this massive naked short bet and don’t feel their beloved GME (who they have DEEP SENTIMENTAL FEELINGS for) is quite the dog its being made out to be and so, just for fun, start buying the stock and placing call options, betting that the price will go up. They talk about it on WSB because that's what we do on WSB. Taking contrary positions is what autists do best. They almost WILL their beloved Gamestop to rise. It does.
Disbelieving billionaire shorts see this and say WTF? This cant be happening That’s what celebrities said during the Great Fappening too. It still happened.

The ground swell grows until it hits critical mass and people are making REAL money. Wuuuut, you can transfer money to Robinhood and they will instantly approve you for trading in options? How hard can this be? People who have never bought a stock or placed an option order in their life are making a killing. Word spreads. More join the fray. More huge wins. Loooks fun! More and more and more jump in.

Meanwhile in hedgietown, things are looking really fucking dire. WTF are these autists doing??? This CAN’T be happening… heeelp I’m melting. They watch their easy money being plundered by a merry band of retards enabled by no less than… Robinhood. Not only is hedgie sure thing easy money evaporating but they appear to have been somewhere they simply could not have believed possible. On the ""wrong side"" of a trade that potential carries a net loss so fucking impressively large that it might destroy some of the largest players on Wall Street and create an event that would cause systemic risk in financial markets. Doh. We done fucked up this time. Wuuuuuut?
   
The ground swell on Reddit turns into a tsunami. It starts to make the news…

A strategy coalesces among the autists. Hey! If we hold and don’t sell wont the price rise? It appears to work.

Hedgies now have lost their appetite and have stopped wanking or fucking and haven’t bathed or shaved in three days. They are drinking that 100 year old scotch they were holding for a special occasion like it was water. Increasingly urgent calls go back and forth among hedge fund managers, bankers and brokerage principals.

On Wednesday January 20th a conference call is arranged between the main players and the CEO of a private firm called Robinhood Holdings.

An offer is made.

 Hedgies: Hey V****. Great little company you got there. It would be a shame if it no longer existed say... next Monday, because it bankrupted the companies that do its settlement and it imploded US financial markets. Wouldn’t you agree? 

RH: (Silence on the line…) 

Hedgies: Here’s a big favor we need from you to prevent that from happening. We need you to halt buying on GME on your platform for a “few hours”. Can you do that favor for us? If you do, we can guarantee you will have our long term support and will ensure that you survive. This will have long term benefits for everyone including you and Robinhood, we assure you.

RH:So you are saying this is a systemic risk event?

Hedgies: Yes, that's what we are saying. 

RH: But what will we tell our account holders? 

Hedgies: It’s only for a few hours. Just tell them settlement issues or liquidity concerns or something. In exchange for this favor, we are going to give you funding to make sure nothing happens to your company. So it’s a win-win. Would a 250 million dollar forgivable loan be okay? 

RH: (A long moment….) Yes, okay.

Hedgies: Done. It’s transferred.

**Upon reaching the agreement for the “favor,” hedgies get to work placing enormous bets on GME for the next day (betting the stock will go down on Thursday). They also place huge call option positions for when the halt on buying is released at a pre-determined time on Friday, betting the price will go up. They know after the halt, a violent price swing will trigger their new short positions and when the halt is lifted the price rise will trigger their call options.**

RH halts buying in GME for “a few hours”. The hedgies new shorts placed on Wednesday (for Thursday) are exercised to the tune of billions. When “limited” buying resumes on Friday, per plan, the price for GME shares rockets higher, triggering the hedgies call strikes. 

Hypothetically speaking, how much could one make if one were a hedgie ~~manipulating~~ saving the market like this? Billions and billions. How much did hedgies need to unwind their positions last Friday, 24 hours before this occurred?? Billions and billions. Hypothetically, that's an amazing coincidence....

Given this hypothetical, would it be enough to unwind more than their Friday positions? How much more? None? Some?

Dunno, WSB I’m just another retard like you. As proof of that I sold GME on Tuesday at 80 and bough BB.

Don’t be retarded like me. HOLD THE DAMN LINE but expect more tricks this week. Goodluck and godspeed.";wallstreetbets

Firstly, i think my idea might take some of the pressure off of the mod mail and excessive post problem so please read! (If you know how)

Billboards and plans flying is great and all, but we need to leverage all these social media platforms as much as possible. If you like the stock GME or AMC or BB, then consider flooding Twitter with hashtags. 

A bs stock I can not mention (so the this can get posted) was just #2 trending on Twitter and they are taking all the hype. As much as only posting and commenting on this sub is great, we need the people who aren’t on Reddit to see that we are not the scumbags that CNBC is making us out to be. 

Take the donation stories, the DD, and Diamond hand emojis and rocket ships over to Twitter and let’s get #GMETOTHEMOON #AMCTOTHEMOON etc trending in front of these bs stocks trying to steer people away from the real prize!

Tweet that video of Jim Cramer exposing market manipulation, and let’s expose the hedge funds. We don’t need CNBC telling everyone how people here are actually using there gains for good we can tell them ourselves! 

The media is being paid by billionaires to make us out to be the bad guys. If 1/5th of the people on this sub each tweeted the same hashtag, we would be number a trending on Twitter and we would be heard!!

What do I know tho, I eat deodorant sticks.

TLDR= 🦍 strong together! Tweet #GMETOTHEMOON and let’s get trending on Twitter! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀🖕🌈🐻

Edit- it seems like bots have hijacked $GME on Twitter claiming the mods of WSB are saying some bs Is the next GME. Report all those accounts";wallstreetbets
jameskwonlee;1612134664;l9oo9m;138;Why It's Smart to Hold - Capitalism 101 and Media Manipulation 101;"\*This is not financial advice. I'm just sharing random thoughts for entertainment purposes only. 

**This upcoming week is the opportunity of a century.**   
**What you do is up to you, but this is how I see things.** 

**First, an overview of what happened last week:**  
\-There was an immense wealth transfer of billions of dollars from HF's like Melvin to the retail investor.  
\-Citron announced that they will no longer enter massive short positions.    
\-Robinhood expands trade restrictions on more stocks, and then retracts them on positions like AMD, AAL and BBBY (no more limits!), and relaxing the share/call restrictions on NOK.  
\-Cramer said last Friday that GME holders ""already won,"" that they must take profits, or otherwise risk ""immense pain"".   
\-CNBC spent all day talking about how risky GME is at this point for the retail investor.   
\-Friday was the lowest day for the market since October 2020.   
\-CNBC also bought ""paid promotions"" on Twitter and FB linking news that Melvin closed all their GME positions. 

Guys, I've worked in the Hollywood TV Industry as a development executive. I know firsthand how the media manipulates the masses. If it's not damn clear by now, we're being manipulated in a textbook fashion so that we sell our positions in ""the stocks we like"". Why? Maybe because Melvin still has short positions. They're a bunch of smart, manipulative bastards. **Except, the bigs f\*d up their media manipulation strategy (or couldn't execute properly due to the overall pandemonium), and I foresee even greater losses for them. Here's why:**

**1) Don't Think of Elephants**

Quoting JGL's character in *Inception*, what happens when someone tells you to not think of elephants? You think of elephants. 

Robinhood essentially outlined which stocks we need to buy by telling us not to buy them. Also, they actually made each of the ""do-not-buy a lot"" stocks more valuable by lowering the supply without lowering the consumer demand.

Actually, how they SHOULD'VE played this was by temporarily adding fees to those specific stocks. This strategy worked for California groceries. Once groceries started charging for plastic bags, people brought their own from home, which stopped excessive use of environmentally hazardous single-use plastic bags. You might think I opened pandora's box on a really good idea. Not really. It's too late. If Robinhood does add fees back, we will migrate to Fidelity, Ameritrade or E\*Trade, if not now, then later. Robinhood's fee structure and profitability is not our problem. They already tarnished their brand. It's too late to add fees now, because it will be ""on top of"" all the bs they did last week. They needed to choose the ""less bad"" decision and picked the worse one. 

**2) Fear, Uncertainty, Destruction (FUD)**

So, in tandem with the brokerages, CNBC and other mainstream news outlets tried to lower the demand on GME, AMC, NOK, BB, etc. by spreading fear that ""retail investors will be in for some real pain"". Do we believe what they're saying? Nope. Why waste precious airtime for the entire day, discouraging retail investors from buying more of the underlying? Because Melvin and other Hf's still have open short positions. Thursday's GME low was $112. If they couldn't buy to close then, they surely didn't do that on Friday. 

**3) Opportunities**

a. **Black Friday of the Century**  
Hold your stonks. Hold your leaps. There's gonna be an immense, pent-up demand and a surge in prices for each of the stocks outlined in Robinhood. They gave us a cheat sheet for what stocks to buy and hold for the immense price hike to come. If you already bought GME and the others, this is like owning a PS5 before everyone got them. Hold, because the prices are gonna be insane. 

b. **Retail Arbitrage of the Century**  
If you didn't already, open up new accounts on E\*trade or Ameritrade, Buy those ""do not buy a lot of"" stocks you can't get on Robinhood. It will be the price arbitrage of the century once Robinhood is forced to lift restrictions on those stocks. Not gonna say more.

TL;DR - There's obvious manipulation by the brokerages and media. Melvin is not in the clear. We must buy and hold, and take advantage of the immense demand surge that'll happen due to the brokerage's desperate, last minute reactive measure. Media manipulation only hints further that GME and other stonks are far from ""done"".";wallstreetbets
jbrandimore;1612134647;l9oo1x;67;A really stupid question on GME and initiating a squeeze.;"Because option sellers try to be delta neutral, what would be wrong with doing a buy/write covered call at the strike price of $1?

Yes, you will lose most of your $1 “investment” as the bid wouldn’t cover your initial cost of $100, but it would set off a nuclear bomb under this and I think a positive feedback loop might take off.

I estimate that if you did this, you would lose $75 or so of your initial $100, but the entertainment might be priceless.

Of course this isn’t advice, I’m spectating on inexpensive entertainment.";wallstreetbets
